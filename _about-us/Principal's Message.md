## Principal's Message

**Greetings from Jurongville Secondary School and welcome!**

On behalf of a grateful school, I would like to pay tribute to Mr Chan Yew Wooi’s steadfast stewardship of the school over the last four years. As we look forward to the years ahead, we will continue to build on the firm foundation that Mr Chan has laid.

In 2023, we welcome the class of 2026 as our first batch of students who will experience Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB). I hope every student will seize the opportunities afforded by the school to pursue their strengths and interests in the time that they have with us.

The last few years have been challenging as we met the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, we remain steadfast in our mission <b>to nurture world-ready students with the passion to learn, lead and serve</b>. Indeed, the changes in our lives in the last three years underscore the need to help our students thrive in an increasing Brittle, Anxious, Non-Linear and Incomprehensible environment.

As we continue to forge ahead together with hope and confidence, we also look forward to celebrating our school’s 30th anniversary in 2024. It is indeed an opportune time for all of us to reflect how far we have come since our founding in 1994; how much we have achieved in these years as well as to show our gratitude to the people and community that have made so much possible for us. As we gear up for the celebrations, I hope our students continue to be true to our school’s motto - <b><i>Beyond Self</i></b>, recognizing that they are the future of our community, society and country. May each of you come to enjoy learning; find ways that you can make a difference and remember that we are all called to serve each other.

For our partners – Parents, Alumnus, and community partners, I invite you to follow us on our social media platforms to stay up to date with what’s happening in and around school.

With my warmest regards<br><br>
Philibert Leow<br>
Principal
