**Rolling with the Punches in 2022**

Just before the new school year began, we received the happy news that Loh Kean Yew, our national badminton player, emerged as World Champion at the tournament in Spain. It was a significant achievement as the previous world badminton champions came from bigger countries like China, Indonesia and India.

At the tournament in Spain, Kean Yew was an unseeded player. In Round 1, he came up against the top-ranked badminton player. He fought hard and secured victory. This gave him the self-belief to go all the way, defeating players higher ranked than himself to emerge as World Champion eventually.

As we begin a new year, there is much that we can learn from our new World Champion. No matter how difficult his situation or circumstances, Kean Yew rolled with the punches, adapted and never gave up. This is the spirit which all our JV-nites will need in the face of challenges. The Covid pandemic, now entering its third year, has affected the livelihood of many families, including those of our students. It has indeed compounded the difficulties especially for our students from more humble backgrounds. Nonetheless, we will support our students and help them stay focused on the learning game at Jurongville --- a game which promises world readiness if they persevere, just like Kean Yew.  
  
This year, we welcome 7 full classes of new Secondary 1 students to our school. More than 80% of them chose our school as one of their first 3 choices. We also welcome back a good number of Secondary 5 students. The Sec 4 Normal Academic classes did very well last year, with 87.5% of them eligible for progression to Secondary 5, the highest eligible rate since 2011. We are proud of the effort put in by every graduating student in the Class of 2021.  
  
This year, we intend to promote student well-being more intentionally through teachers’ interaction with the students. Inspired by positive psychology, or the science of well-being, we will nurture student well-being through promoting Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment and Health, or in short, PERMAH. When students feel good, and like the school, their classmates and their teachers, they will thrive and flourish.  
  
Our Sec 2, 3 and 4 students received their Chromebooks in July last year. The new Sec 1 students will be getting theirs later this year. A key professional focus of the teachers will be to leverage students’ Personal Learning Devices to help them learn more actively in the classroom. Effective use of the devices will help our students to develop their innovative and critical thinking, as well as help them acquire the habits and skills of a self-directed and collaborative learner. These qualities will help them to learn well in school and throughout their lives.

For visitors who want to know more about our school through this website, I welcome your interest, queries and feedback. If you would like to offer your partnership in areas that contribute to our students’ holistic development, our school is open to possibilities. Please email the school ([jurongville@moe.edu.sg](mailto:jurongville@moe.edu.sg)) and we will respond as soon as we can.  
  
 Let’s all look forward to a year full of good health and joyful learning in 2022!
