## Principal's Message

**Greetings from Jurongville Secondary School and welcome!**

As we celebrate 30 years of nurturing students in 2024, we are proud to invite you to explore what makes Jurongville Secondary School a unique and inspiring place for your child's secondary education. At Jurongville, we don’t just prepare students for exams—we prepare them for life.
For three decades, we have been committed to developing well-rounded individuals who are ready to make a positive difference in the world. Our approach to education goes beyond academics, focusing on character development, leadership skills, and community engagement. We believe that every student has the potential to excel, and it is our mission to provide them with the guidance, opportunities, and support they need to do so.

Since our founding, we have educated over 13,750 students, with generations of families trusting us with their children’s growth and development. With an impressive record of academic and non academic success, our students consistently perform well, but what truly sets Jurongville apart is our strong community spirit and the values we instill in each individual. Our alumni are not just graduates; they are change-makers who have gone on to impact their communities, professions, and the world.

**A School that Nurtures Beyond the Classroom**

At Jurongville, learning is not confined to textbooks. Our students are encouraged to explore their passions through a wide range of co-curricular activities (CCAs), leadership programs, and service-learning projects. These experiences are designed to develop essential life skills such as teamwork, resilience, empathy, and responsibility. Our robust curriculum and enriching programs ensure that every student has the opportunity to grow holistically, discovering their strengths and passions along the way.

**Partnerships that Support Success**

Our success is not achieved alone. Over the years, Jurongville has fostered strong partnerships with the wider community, including our esteemed alumni, parents, and local organizations. These collaborations provide our students with invaluable real-world exposure, mentorship opportunities, and career guidance, further enhancing their learning experiences. Our School Advisory Committee, in particular, has played a key role in supporting our growth, ensuring that we continue to evolve and provide the best education possible for every student who walks through our doors.

**Heritage and Vision for the Future**

As we look back on our 30 years of achievements, we are equally focused on the future. Our school’s heritage is one of resilience, innovation, and inclusivity, and we are constantly adapting to meet the evolving needs of our students in a dynamic world. 

At the heart of our school is a simple yet powerful motto: "*Beyond Self*." This ethos drives everything we do, from how we teach to how we engage with the community. We encourage our students to look beyond their own interests and contribute to the greater good, embodying values of perseverance, respect, integrity, discipline and empathy
