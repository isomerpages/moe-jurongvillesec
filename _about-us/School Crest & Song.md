#### The School Crest

**The New School Crest**<br>
Featuring both the English and Chinese names of the school, the new crest signifies the school’s connection with the proud contributions of the students, staff and stakeholders of both constituent school communities.  
  
Set against the globe, the two leaves represent the students and their growth in a nurturing school environment. The globe represents the school’s aspiration to help all students acquire the values, knowledge and skills necessary to thrive and live meaningfully in Singapore and beyond.

We are the students from Jurongville <br>
Our school, our alma mater <br>
We stand united as we pledge <br>
To give our best to Jurongville <br><br>
Our school crest symbolises growth <br>
Reminding us as we mature <br>
Though each of us may be unique<br> 
In spirit we share but one aim <br><br>
We’ll always serve with steadfastness <br>
And honour her ideal <br>
To be committed and responsible <br>
And give beyond ourselves with zeal <br><br>
And with truth as our guiding light <br>
We’ll bravely venture forth <br>
To answer every worthwhile call<br> 
And do our best for one and all <br><br>
We are the students from Jurongville <br>
Our school, our alma mater <br>
We stand united as we pledge <br>
To give our best to Jurongville
