## School History

In 2019, Jurongville Secondary School merged with Hong Kah Secondary School. The merger decision and its intent was shared by the Ministry of Education with the two schools in April 2017. After the decision was shared with all students, staff, parents and stakeholders, both schools collaborated closely to ensure a smooth transition when school reopened in January 2019.

There are close parallels in the history of both constituent schools. Both Jurongville Secondary and Hong Kah Secondary received their first batch of Secondary One students in 1994. Situated a short distance apart along Jurong East Avenue 1, both schools served the residents of Jurong faithfully and well for a quarter of a century. Interestingly, the name ‘Hong Kah’ could be traced back to a village in pre-industrialised Jurong. That village was popularly known in Teochew, a Chinese dialect, as ‘Hong Kah Choon’, which means ‘Christian Village’. To reflect the shared heritage, MOE decided that the merged school will be known as Jurongville Secondary School in English and 丰嘉中学 in Chinese. 

Both schools were led by a string of outstanding principals. The founding principal of Jurongville Secondary was Mdm Sun Huey Min. Mdm Sun served as the school’s Principal from 1994 to 1995. The founding principal of Hong Kah Secondary was Mrs Yeo Chin Nam. Mrs Yeo served the school from 1994 to 1997.

Mr Chan Yew Wooi, previously Director / Professional Development, Academy of Singapore Teachers, was appointed principal of Jurongville Secondary School from 15 December 2018.

Mr Philibert Leow is the current Principal of Jurongville Secondary School. He has taken over the leadership of the school from Mr Chan with effect from 15 December 2022.

To reflect the new beginning, with the coming together of the staff and students of both schools in 2019, the school uniform and PE attire of the school were refreshed with inputs from the students. Similarly, a new school crest incorporating key elements from both school crests was created. Featuring both the English and Chinese names of the school, the new crest signifies the school’s connection with the proud contributions of the students, staff and stakeholders of both constituent school communities.

Set against the globe, the two leaves represent the students and their growth in a nurturing school environment. The globe represents the school’s aspiration to help all students acquire the values, knowledge and skills necessary to thrive and live meaningfully in Singapore and beyond.

**Looking Ahead to the next 25 Years**

As the school embarks on the next quarter of a century, the school will remember the intent of the merger, which is to provide ever better holistic educational experiences for all the current and future students of the school. The school motto ‘Beyond Self’ is a reminder to all staff and students that we are in this educational enterprise for a larger purpose. When we take our mission and responsibilities to heart, we shape lives, improve our communities and mould the future of our nation.
