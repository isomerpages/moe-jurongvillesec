## School Safety

To smoothen traffic flow and for students’ safety, our school has collaborated with the Traffic Police in implementing a No-Right Turn regulation for vehicles leaving the school premises between 6.30 am and 7.30 am. Drivers are strongly advised to adhere to this regulation.

To inculcate the good habit of punctuality and to facilitate the conduct of daily morning assembly, the school’s main gate will be closed at 7.25 am daily. An alternative point to drop students off is the HDB car-park beside Blk 329.
