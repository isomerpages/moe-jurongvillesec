#### A Holistic Education for Secondary School Students - LEAPS 2.0

A holistic education provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning not just in the academic areas. Equally important is the development of values and life skills in each child. This will equip the child to handle the challenges in life later on. 

A holistic education also supports students to discover their strengths, interests and talents. Students tend to flourish in areas they are interested in. Thus, as far as possible, we should allow them to pursue their areas of interest. 

Schools offer a range of co-curricular programmes to help students achieve a holistic education. Community service is also invaluable in helping students develop qualities such as care, concern and respect for others in society.

#### LEAPS 2.0

LEAPS 2.0 is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic development. Students will be recognised with levels of attainment in four domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.

**SUPPORTING YOUR CHILD**

As parents, you play an important role in ensuring your child’s holistic and balanced development. Your child benefits most when the emphasis on developing values, life skills and your child/ward’s interests and strengths are reinforced at home. 

You can discuss the following areas with your child when selecting his/her co-curricular activities: 

*   Identifying interests and strengths<br>
Example: What is your child interested in? What is your child good at?  
*   Setting objectives<br>
Example: What kind of person does your child want to be? What kind of values and life skills should your child be developed in?  
*   Encouraging self-directed learning<br>
Example: How does your child want to pursue this development? What are the possible opportunities that can help support this development?  
*   Managing commitments<br>
Example: Is your child able to cope? How can you help to support him/her in the learning pursuits?

#### LEAPS 2.0 DOMAINS

**Participation**

This domain recognises students’ participation in one school-based Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). Recognition is based on the number of years of participation and exemplary conduct and active contribution to the CCA. Sustained engagement in the same CCA allows for progressive development of character, skills, knowledge and friendships, and will be accorded higher recognition. 

**Service**

This domain recognises students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community. Every secondary school student will contribute at least 6 hours per school year to the community. They can choose to embark on a Values-In-Action project (VIA). Students will be recognised for the time they put into planning, service and reflection, when participating in a VIA project. 

**Leadership**

This domain recognises students’ leadership development. Recognition is accorded to students’ ability to take charge of personal development, work in a team and assume responsibilities in service of others. In addition to formal leadership appointments, participation in student leadership modules/workshops, the National Youth Achievement Award (NYAA) and leadership positions in the school, CCA or student-initiated/student-led projects will also be recognised.

**Achievement**

This domain recognises students’ **representation** and **accomplishment** in co-curricular involvements beyond the classroom. Opportunities for representation and accomplishment present valuable learning experiences for students to learn discipline, resilience and develop their character. Students may represent the school or organisations endorsed by the school. Recognising external opportunities better caters to students’ diverse interests and talents. It also recognises the community’s role in developing the child. 

Representation refers to being selected and endorsed by the school or an organisation endorsed by the school (e.g. the community club or national association) to contribute, perform or compete. It need not be tied to his/her CCA in school. 

Accomplishment refers to attaining accolades and awards at competitions, festivals, performances, exhibitions, conferences and symposiums where the student represents the school or other organisations endorsed by the school.

The details on the levels of attainment for each of the domains are attached at [Annex A](/files/LEAPS%2020%20-%20Annex%20A.pdf).

**Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment**

At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Education (JC/Poly/ITE).

| Co-Curricular Attainment | Details |
|:---:|---|
| Excellent (2 bonus points) | Student who attains a minimum Level 3 in all four domains with at least a Level 4 in one domain. |
| Good (1 bonus point) | Student who attains a minimum Level 1 in all four domains with any one of the following:   <br>i.  At least Level 2 in three domains; <br>ii.  At least Level 2 in one domain and at least Level 3 in another domain; or <br>iii.  At least Level 4 in one domain. |
| Fair | Student’s attainment in co-curricular will not translate into any bonus points |
