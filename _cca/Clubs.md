<h2>InfoMedia Club</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>The InfoMedia Club CCA aims to excite students about Information Communication
and Technology (ICT) in a fun and meaningful way. Students are exposed
to a wide variety of topics such as AV media, photography, videography
and basic programming. They are equipped with the technical knowledge to
operate AV equipment and cameras, so as to provide support for and coverage
of school events. Additionally, they are taught photo- and video-editing
skills for media production, and often work with external partners to enhance
their learning experience. InfoMedia Club has embarked on a new expedition
in the field of coding. Members are now learning how to code and program.
LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime are used as a STEAM learning tool for the
members that engages them through playful learning activities to think
critically and solve complex problems.</p>
<p>The club also aims to cultivate leadership capabilities and forge strong
friendships and a sense of camaraderie among members. The executive committee
members are tasked to lead, plan training programmes and organise activities
for the other members, ranging from weekly school assemblies, team-bonding
sessions to farewell ceremony.</p>

<h4>Students' voices</h4>
<p><strong>Lee Pei En (4PA) , Exco 2020</strong> 
<br><em>Hello my fellow juniors, i am Pei En, your former CCA president. I would like thank everyone who put in so much hard work in encouraging and inspiring each other. Things will get hard but don’t be afraid to ask for help. When you see someone struggling just give them a helping hand. Work together and build a strong team. Do remember all the things the EXCOS have taught you. If all else fails, go to teachers! Work hard and continue to have FUN! Good luck!!!</em>

Through my teachings with them, i was able to understand them more which made us closer. I will truly cherish all the moments and time i have spent with my friends,teachers and my fellow juniors.</em>
