## Infocomm Club

#### About

The InfoComm Club CCA aims to excite students about Information Communication and Technology (ICT) in a fun and meaningful way. Students are exposed to a wide variety of topics such as AV media, photography, videography and basic programming. They are equipped with the technical knowledge to operate AV equipment and cameras, so as to provide support for and coverage of school events. Additionally, they are taught photo- and video-editing skills for media production, and often work with external partners to enhance their learning experience. Infocomm Club has embarked on a new expedition in the field of coding. Members are now learning how to code and program. LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime are used as a STEAM learning tool for the members that engages them through playful learning activities to think critically and solve complex problems.  
  
The club also aims to cultivate leadership capabilities and forge strong friendships and a sense of camaraderie among members. The executive committee members are tasked to lead, plan training programmes and organise activities for the other members, ranging from weekly school assemblies, team-bonding sessions to farewell ceremony.

_Hello my fellow juniors, i am Pei En, your former CCA president. I would like thank everyone who put in so much hard work in encouraging and inspiring each other. Things will get hard but don’t be afraid to ask for help. When you see someone struggling just give them a helping hand. Work together and build a strong team. Do remember all the things the EXCOS have taught you. If all else fails, go to teachers! Work hard and continue to have FUN! Good luck!!!_
