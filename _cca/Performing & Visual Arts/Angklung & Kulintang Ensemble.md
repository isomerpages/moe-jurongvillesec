<h2>Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>The aim of the Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble is to promote music appreciation
through the playing of two Traditional Malay instruments — the Angklung
and Kulintang — which originate from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>During CCA sessions, members learn the technical skills of playing the
Angklung or Kulintang and acquire a theoretical foundation in music. Though
these training sessions, we also cultivate discipline and patience among
our members, allowing them to become skillful in playing music.</p>
<p>Our CCA members have the experience to collaborate with other performing
arts group during this year 30th Anniversary Prize Conferment Ceremony.
The angklung’s versatility and adaptability make it an ideal instrument
for collaboration. This innovative collaboration has the potential to create
captivating performances, blending the angklung’s gentle tones with the
dynamic beats of other performing groups’ instruments. It showcases the
beauty of cultural fusion and the boundless possibilities of musical expression.</p>

<h4>Students' voices</h4>
<p><strong>BOON WAI SEE (3-Passion, 2024)</strong>
<br><em>‘Joining Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble has taught me perseverance, resilience and discipline. I participated in Singapore Youth Festival 2023 and even though we didn't get the achievement we aimed for; our bond has become stronger during our practice together. I feel motivated and dedicated to achieving distinction next SYF.’</em>

<p><strong>NUR QAISARA HUSNA BTE HUSSIN (2-Discipline, 2024)</strong>
<br><em>‘During the CCA sessions, I have learnt how to work effectively as a team. Angklung is all about teamwork so being in this CCA has taught me how to be patient and how to work together with my peers. One memorable experience I had was during the JVS 30th Anniversary Prize Conferment Ceremony. My CCA members and I had spent a lot of time preparing for the performance and it sounded really good on the performance day.’</em>

<p><strong>KISHOORKUMAR SIVAKUMAR (1-Discipline, 2024)</strong>
<br><em>‘A year filled with love for music. I joined Angklung &amp; Kulintang Ensemble without much knowledge 𝗍𝗁𝗂𝗇𝗄𝗈𝗇𝗀 𝗂𝗍 𝗐𝗈𝗎𝗅𝖽 𝖻𝖾 𝖻𝗈𝗋𝗂𝗇𝗀. 𝖧𝗈𝗐𝖾𝗏𝖾𝗋, 𝖺s I started to play Angklung, I started to appreciate the music notes. Working together with my peers, it helped to level up my skills. Being someone who has stage fright, this CCA helped me to overcome that. I am glad to be part of many performances in year 2024 especially the 30th anniversary concert.’</em>
