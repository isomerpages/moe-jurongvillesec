<h2>Chinese Orchestra</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>Chinese Orchestra is not just a CCA. It’s so much more than that. It’s
a family, or a calling, or an oasis, if you will.</p>
<p>There's nothing quite like immersing yourself in chords and melodies to
revitalize your soul and recharge your spirit, while reveling in the company
of like-minded friends who simply want the best for each other. We are
glad that many young prospects took the proverbial leap of faith and placed
their trust in us for a transformational experience.</p>
<p>Celebrating our school’s 30th anniversary this year, our performance at
the Prize Conferment Ceremony featured a collaboration with Modern Dance,
as we delighted the audience with the upbeat tone and catchy tune of the
Japanese hit single “Odoru Ponpokorin”.</p>
<p>By the time National Day came around, we are pleased to witness the steady
growth of our Sec 1s, as they have raised their proficiency to join us
in performing “Those Bygone Years”, tugging at the nostalgic heartstrings
of fans of the Taiwanese film “You Are the Apple of My Eye”.</p>
<p>With a Certificate of Distinction to defend at next year’s Singapore Youth
Festival (SYF), we will continue to invest our best effort into every practice
and strive to improve at every session. No matter how miniscule it feels,
we will keep the faith and last the journey, wherever it may take us.</p>
<p>Now join us in painting a canvas of unforgettable memories together, will
you?</p>

<h4>Students’ voices</h4>
<p><strong>Ng Zhen Zhen, President</strong>
<br><em>“During my time in Chinese Orchestra, not only have I developed my proficiency in playing my instrument, I have also learnt to adapt to different situations and learnt how to work with different groups of people. I have also realized the importance of adopting an open mindset and think of different ways to resolve the problems that we encounter, to ensure a conducive and engaging learning environment for all. I hope that my juniors will learn as much, make many new friends and have an enjoyable time in Chinese Orchestra too.”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Wong Yu Lin Eliz, Vice-President</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Being in Chinese Orchestra has taught me to be conscientious and resilient both in practising my instrument and improving my personal qualities, be it as a member or as a leader. I have learnt how an orchestra has to work together to move forward to achieve the best outcome, especially when approaching Singapore Youth Festival. I have really enjoyed my time in Chinese Orchestra, forged strong bonds with my CCA mates, gained countless fond memories and hope that my juniors will cherish their time in this CCA. I wish them all the best for the challenges that await them.”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Ke Yi En, Vice-President</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Joining Chinese Orchestra has unearthed the hidden potential within each of us. I discovered mine: empowering others to shine. As a leader, I support and guide, helping members overcome challenges and reach new heights. With Singapore Youth Festival approaching, I see dedication and passion from the members. I appreciate the efforts made, memories shared, and friendships forged. My heart goes out to each member striving for excellence. I'm committed to helping them unlock their potential, embrace growth, and become the best versions of themselves. Together, we'll shine, celebrating every triumph and learning from every setback. All the best!”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Chew Wen Hui, Vice-President</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“As someone who was appointed the leader in spite of joining Chinese Orchestra a year later than everyone else, I feel honored by the trust and recognition of my teachers and batchmates. I am proud to say that Chinese Orchestra is the place where I have had the happiest time since I came to this school. Even though I had no musical background, I felt cared for and helped by everyone. I am very fortunate to have experienced the transformation of my life here, and I wish all juniors joining this big family a wonderful experience in the future.”</em>
