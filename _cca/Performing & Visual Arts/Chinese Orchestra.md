## Chinese Orchestra

#### About

Chinese Orchestra is not just a CCA. It is so much more than that. It’s a home that we can always come back to. Come rain or shine.  
  
The memories shared. The inspired moments. The collective experience.  
  
Against the backdrop of a pandemic, SYF preparation has never been more difficult, as we toggled between face-to-face and online practices, while managing a slew of safety measures. Yet we remained unfazed by the challenge and relished the journey. From clinching the Certificate of Accomplishment to enjoying a dialogue with the composer, it was a rewarding experience for all our members.  
  
As difficult a year as it has been, it did not stop us from bonding through fun and laughter on Games Day. Neither did it thwart us from performing to a captive audience for Chinese New Year and Teachers’ Day e-concerts. We expressed appreciation for our instructors and encouragement for each other’s exams through designing e-cards. We found strength, in ourselves and each other.  
  
We can’t promise that it will be a better year ahead, but we assure you that we will soldier on and brave through this together, every step of the way. Join us.

#### Students’ voices

**Neo Eng Jun (4DP), President** <br>
_“What Chinese Orchestra has taught me is far more than learning a new instrument. Being in the CCA has made me step out of my comfort zone to reach out for new things that encourages my growth. And the growth in mindset and leadership skills has never stopped throughout the years! In each and every session, I am learning new things from everyone, no matter juniors or seniors. I hope that my juniors would also be able to create their own moment and become a better self through the series of opportunities provided in the CCA!”_  
  
**Wong Shi Min Tiana (4EM), Vice-President** <br>
_“Before I joined Chinese Orchestra, I was unsure of my own leadership capabilities. I’ll admit that learning the erhu was hard at the start, but through the support of my instructor and my peers, I was inspired to work hard to master this instrument. However, playing the instrument was not the only thing I learnt. I learnt how to communicate well with others and how to lead with the support of my friends around me. I was able to build up my confidence and be the leader that my juniors look up to. To the juniors, I hope that you will cherish the time you have and give it your all, while forging friendships in this CCA. I’m sure one day you will be able to look back and see all the effort you invested into this CCA has paid off.”_  
 
**Cho Yin Men (4IN), Secretary** <br>
_“During my time in Chinese Orchestra, I have made beautiful memories and forged strong friendships. While learning to play the Yangqin, I have learnt that good habits are formed through consistent effort. Dear juniors, although sometimes hardships may be discouraging, remember that you will always have your friends and family to support you. Sometimes, all you need is faith in yourself to face your obstacles. Trust in yourself, and keep practising. You can do it!”_
