<h2>Chinese Orchestra</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>Chinese Orchestra is not just a CCA. It’s so much more than that. It’s
a family, or a calling, or an oasis, if you will.</p>
<p>There's nothing quite like immersing yourself in chords and melodies to
revitalize your soul and recharge your spirit, while reveling in the company
of like-minded friends who simply want the best for each other. We are
glad that many young prospects took the proverbial leap of faith and placed
their trust in us for a transformational experience.</p>
<p>Celebrating our school’s 30th anniversary this year, our performance at
the Prize Conferment Ceremony featured a collaboration with Modern Dance,
as we delighted the audience with the upbeat tone and catchy tune of the
Japanese hit single “Odoru Ponpokorin”.</p>
<p>By the time National Day came around, we are pleased to witness the steady
growth of our Sec 1s, as they have raised their proficiency to join us
in performing “Those Bygone Years”, tugging at the nostalgic heartstrings
of fans of the Taiwanese film “You Are the Apple of My Eye”.</p>
<p>With a Certificate of Distinction to defend at next year’s Singapore Youth
Festival (SYF), we will continue to invest our best effort into every practice
and strive to improve at every session. No matter how miniscule it feels,
we will keep the faith and last the journey, wherever it may take us.</p>
<p>Now join us in painting a canvas of unforgettable memories together, will
you?</p>

<h4>Students’ voices</h4>
<p><strong>Odelia Jane Seet Ming Yue, President</strong>
<br><em>“Although I have already learned how to play a couple of instruments before joining Chinese Orchestra, my learning didn’t stagnate here. I have moved on to learn what it meant to lead a big group of people of similar age. Throughout my entire journey of being in CO, I have made friends and built relationships from Sec 1 to Sec 4. To be placed in charge is a privilege, especially since I'm only 15. As my juniors rise up to lead, I hope that they can learn to cherish every moment in CO.”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Chloe Tang Wei Xin, Vice-President</strong>
<br><em>“Throughout the years of joining Chinese Orchestra, not only have I learnt to play an instrument, I have also learnt the importance of teamwork in an orchestra. After joining CO, I realized that I became more comfortable with public speaking and I also became more confident by taking the initiative and helping others in the orchestra. I have also made many new friends and created many unforgettable bonds with others, regardless of seniority. To my juniors, continue to work together and don’t ever give up. Believe in yourselves!”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Aw Yong Chen Mei Shermaine, Secretary</strong>
<br><em>“By joining Chinese Orchestra, not only did I learn a new instrument and advance my skills, I also learnt to persevere through challenging times such as when a performance was coming up or when there was Singapore Youth Festival. I have no regrets joining CO, as it has allowed me to create fond memories and bonded friendships with CCA mates from various levels that I will definitely cherish forever. To my dear juniors, I hope you will continue to enjoy your time in CO and remember to strive through the hard times together as one orchestra.”</em>
