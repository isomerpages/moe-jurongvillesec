## Chinese Orchestra

#### About
Chinese Orchestra is not just a CCA. It's a second home where all our memories belong. 

Good or bad, happy or sad, all of our experiences and memories are shared between CO members, bonding us together like one family.

With the resumption of normal practice, we put up a variety of performances, including e-concerts for Chinese New Year and Speech Day. We even performed Josh Groban’s hit single “You Raise Me Up” on Teachers’ Day to a live (and enchanted) audience.

Furthermore, with the relaxation of safety measures, CO has increased in fun and excitement! This year’s Games Day was a blast, while we embarked on a learning journey to Chui Huay Lim Club for a live concert. We expressed our appreciation for our instructors with e-cards and gifts, and bid farewell to the Sec 4s with a farewell party.

Preparing for SYF is a long and arduous journey but we are steadily pushing through to achieve a Distinction. With unrelenting effort and unwavering conviction, we will do our best to make CO proud.

CO will always be there for us, through and through. With new members joining us, we are confident of many more fun memories to come. So join us, pronto!

#### Students’ voices
**Kwek Sin En (4IN), President**<br>
_“Having played the same instrument for 7 years, I have learnt that just because you have spent a long time in the trade, it does not make you perfect and there is always room for improvement. As long as we devote the effort and time to practise, we can easily better ourselves and exceed expectations. Chinese Orchestra is more than just learning to play instruments. I have created many bonds and memories with my CCA mates that I will cherish forever. I hope my juniors will enjoy their time in the orchestra, forming long-lasting friendships with their CCA mates.”_

**Carrie Tan Si Yan (4EM), Vice-President**<br>
_“In my years of being in Chinese Orchestra, I have learnt how to play an instrument. In addition, I have developed better organizational skills and teamwork, while mustered the courage to step out of my comfort zone. Throughout my stint here, I have forged many fond memories and built precious friendships with my CCA mates. CO has offered me a sense of comfort and belonging, with the CO room akin to my second home. To my juniors, I hope that you are able to create loving memories of CO and continue investing your best effort in your future endeavors.”_

**Lim Hui Zhen (4IN), Secretary**<br>
_“Chinese Orchestra is not merely about playing an instrument. Joining this CCA has imbued me with a myriad of new skills, such as leadership and musicianship. CO has given me the platform to live out the school core values such as perseverance and empathy, and it encourages me to become a better person. I have also forged great memories with my peers after joining this CCA, which is something that I will never regret! To my dear juniors, I hope you have enjoyed the times spent in CO with your juniors and seniors, and that you can strive for a better self and continue to excel in the CCA.”_
