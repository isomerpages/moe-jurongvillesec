## Drumatix Batucada

#### About

Drumatix Batucada is a sub-style of samba and refers to an African-influenced Brazilian percussive style, usually performed by an ensemble. The music is characterised by its repetitive style and fast pace. Many times, we have wowed crowds with our synergy and vibrancy. Members have learnt to collaborate and display great team spirit and adaptability during the various public performances. In addition, members learn discipline and perseverance through their CCA and our leaders are groomed to lead and serve the school and community.  
  
In 2021, our first performance was for Speech Day in April. The rousing performance was well received by all. It helped to hone the leadership qualities of the office bearers and build camaraderie between the members.  
  
During their e-CCA sessions, members from Sec 1 to 3 produced a virtual video for the Teachers’ Day e-Concert in Term 3. They paid a loving tribute to their teachers.  
  
In spite of the challenges brought on by COVID, the energy and passion of Drumatix Batucada has never wavered. Our students and teachers all look forward to the future with enthusiasm!

#### Students' voices

**Nur Fathin Inshiqah Binte Muhammad Rohaizad, President, 3 Respect**<br> 
_Being in Drumatix Batucada has taught me a lot about music and leadership qualities. This is my third year and so far, I have gained more confidence than before. I have learned how to lead my juniors and be a good leader for my section. These 3 years are filled with many memories that are unforgettable. I really enjoy being in this CCA and I am proud to be a member of Drumatix Batucada._

_Batucada is a place where I can be myself. I get to release all my stress from studying and it is very fun. I get to hang out with my bandmates and know them better as friends. Being the conductor is tough as controlling the flow of the song is a demanding task. However, I accept the role 100% and I’m willing to work hard to master it. I hope that the CCA will continue to grow and develop students into energetic, expressive percussionists._

_Dramatix Batucada has become one of my healing places. The people, energy and atmosphere made me feel welcomed from the start. Ever since secondary 1, I have gained much experience on how to lead and be a part of a team with my CCA mates. I have overcome my stage fright and gained confidence while performing. Being in Drumatix Batucada is a blessing I never thought I would get._
