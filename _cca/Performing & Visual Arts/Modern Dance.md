## Modern Dance

#### About

The Modern Dance CCA consists of passionate dancers who are devoted to sharing their love of dance through various dance forms from traditional Lion dance to modern contemporary pieces. Our dancers have become more passionate and confident through our training sessions and various performances.  
Modern Dance was a proud recipient of the Certificate of Accomplishment in this year’s Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2021. This year, we are committed to our dance practices, be it online or the various virtual performances that we have done in 2020-2021.  
  
We are constantly on the lookout for collaboration with like-minded partners. One notable programme was in 2019 where we partnered with the Dance CCA in Hua Yi Secondary school. We hope to continue doing so in the years to come.  
  
The Modern Dance CCA remains determined to bring the joy and beauty of dance to everyone no matter the circumstance, and our members are eagerly looking forward to performing more in the future!

#### Students' voices

**Janelle Fun, 3N1 President 20/21** <br>
_My time in International Dance has been enjoyable so far and I have been well taken care of by the seniors. I would like to encourage all aspiring dancers to join this CCA, and pursue your love for dance. I hope all dancers will continue to follow your passion and appreciate the opportunities you receive for being a member of the International Dance club!

**Shrisha, 3N2 Dancer 20/21** <br>
_I only managed to join dance in secondary two and I am glad I make the choice to do it. At first, I was really scared to join dance as I only did not know many of the dancers and not alot about dancing. However, I eventually became comfortable interacting with my seniors, juniors, and peers. I am happy to be in dance as I have loved dancing since I was a young girl. I hope all my juniors will have fun in dance and enjoy yourselves!_
