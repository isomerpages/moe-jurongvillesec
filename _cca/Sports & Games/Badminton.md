## Badminton

#### About
The JVS Badminton training programme aims to inculcate in our players the schoolâ€™s PRIDE values, and to develop their passion, sportsmanship and excellence in the sport.

Our B and C Division boys and girls took part in the West Zone Badminton Competitions this year and we are pleased that our B Division girls were qualified to participate in the 2nd round of NSG. The experience that they have will be invaluable for them to improve their skills and to train hard for future competitions.

The school would like to commend the Captains and Vice-Captains for their excellent role in leading the B and C Division teams this year.
