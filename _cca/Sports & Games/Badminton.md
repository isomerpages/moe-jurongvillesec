#### About
The JVS Badminton training programme for the school team and recreational players aims to inculcate in our players the school’s PRIDE values, and to develop their passion, sportsmanship and excellence in the sport. While the school team attended rigorous weekly training sessions to prepare for competitions, the recreational players hone their badminton skills through guidance from the school team players.  
  
Our B Division boys and girls took part in a few games in the West Zone Badminton Competitions at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic situation, the remaining games were  
were cancelled. Despite facing strong opponents in the games they have played, our players fought hard and had performed relatively well. The experience that they have will be invaluable for them to improve their skills and to train hard for the competitions  
  
The school would like to commend the Captain, Lau Yue Hang (4DP) and Aw Jing Xuan (3DP) and Vice-Captains Kesavaram Jignesh (4EM), Wee Si Han Jayden (5PA) and Lim Yu En Aris (3EM) for their excellent role in leading the B Division teams this year. They have led their teams well and have demonstrated the school values of perseverance and discipline on and off the court.
