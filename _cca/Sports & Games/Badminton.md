## Badminton

#### About
The JVS Badminton training programme aims to inculcate in our players the school’s PRIDE values, and to develop their passion, sportsmanship and excellence in the sport.

Our B and C Division boys and girls took part in the West Zone Badminton Competitions this year and we are pleased that our B Division girls were qualified to participate in the 2nd round of NSG. The experience that they have will be invaluable for them to improve their skills and to train hard for future competitions.

The school would like to commend the Captains and Vice-Captains for their excellent role in leading the B and C Division teams this year.

#### Students' voices
**Rayn Irfan Lum Jun Heng (4 Discipline), B Division Boys’ team Captain** <br>
_Throughout my years in Badminton, I have learnt many important core values. With the guidance of my coaches and teachers, I learnt to be more disciplined in training and resilient when faced with challenges. To my juniors, achieving success will not be easy, but as long as you put in the hard work, you will definitely see the results!_  
  
**Faith Ng (4 Passion), B Division Girls’ team Captain** <br>
_Although I joined the team only in Sec 3, it was still very fulfilling. I have learnt never to give up until the last point because there is always a chance you can come back from a game that looks unwinnable. I have also learnt how to take the initiative and help my team during training and competitions. To my juniors, I am super proud of every single one of you and I hope you will never give up during difficult times._
