<h2>Badminton</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>The JVS Badminton training programme aims to inculcate in our players
the school’s PRIDE values, and to develop their passion, sportsmanship
and excellence in the sport.</p>
<p>Our B and C Division boys and girls took part in the NSG B and C Division
boys and girls Badminton Competitions this year and we are pleased that
our C Division Boys were qualified to participate in the Playoff Round.
The experience that they have will be invaluable for them to improve their
skills and to train hard for future competitions.</p>
<p>The school would like to commend the Captains and Vice-Captains for their
excellent role in leading the B and C Division teams this year.</p>

<h4>Students' voices</h4>
<p><strong>BALATHIRUMURUGAN MONIESH 4RS, B Division Boys’ team Captain</strong> 
<br>It has been a great experience being in the team, training and bonding
with my team mates. As Captain of the team, I have learnt to be disciplined

would like to encourage my juniors to continue to work hard and to achieve
success in whatever they do.</p>
<p><strong>ELYANA NOOR SHAZWINA BINTI MUHAMMAD AIDIL 4IN, B Division Girls’ team Captain</strong>
