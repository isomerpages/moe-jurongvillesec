<p><em>Some of the value’s basketball have taught me is the importance of perseverance and integrity. Even with the pandemic, we must persevere and have integrity so that we won't cheat ourselves during training when no one's around. As the captain, I've also learnt to be more conscious of my actions and behavior as I am a role model for my teammates.</em>
