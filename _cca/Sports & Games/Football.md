#### About

_Devoted. Determined. Disciplined._&nbsp;These are the words to describe our JVS Football team. The JVS football programme is the premier footballing programme in the West. It merges two of the top footballing schools in the area, Hong Kah Secondary and Jurongville Secondary. Both schools have previously won many accolades in youth football and have reputable youth development programmes.  
  
As a testament of the strength of the football team, the school has gone on to clinch football titles in both the B and C divisions in the first year of our merger. At JVS we take pride in the development of our players and put in place resources to ensure that players are given the best chance to fulfill their footballing potential. Players are guided by professional coaches and dedicated teachers to ensure that the student athletes develop holistically.  
  
In 2020, the team was steadfast in continuing our training through our e-CCA programme so that students remain fit and ready student athletes.

#### Students' voices
**Kota Leela Karthikeya (4E3), Captain (2021):** <br>
_“As a captain for the B Division team, I am proud to represent Jurongville Secondary School. Our aim was to become the champions again in 2021 but unfortunately, we couldn’t participate due to Covid-19. However, we were glad that we can still train together and learn new technical skills. I wish all the very best to my juniors and Jurongville Secondary School. ”_
