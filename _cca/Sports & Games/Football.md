<h4>About</h4>
<p>Jurongville Secondary School’s Football team has the premier footballing
programme in the West. We have performed well in past inter-school competitions
and has won many accolades in youth football and have reputable youth development
programmes. When the school merged with Hong Kah Secondary in 2019, we
tapped on the strengths of both schools and emerged as National Champions
in the "B" Division League 1 NSG.</p>
<p>The school’s football teams are centred around Jurongville’s values of
perseverance, respect and discipline as we focus on developing the boys
as good footballers and students. Discipline on and off the field are equally
important to us. This approach has paid off in terms of developing a team
of boys with both the skills and discipline to do well in matches, as well
as laying the foundation for semi-professional or professional football
in future for selected players. Moreover, the players are guided by professional
coaches and dedicated teachers to ensure that our student athletes develop
holistically.</p>

<h4>Unleash the Roar! – School Football Academy (SFA)</h4>
<p>In collaboration with SportSG and FAS, Jurongville Secondary school came
on board a School Football Academy (SFA) programme from 2022. It provides
talented young football players with an enhanced training environment to
develop their football abilities, while balancing the rigour of studies.</p>
<p>The SFA programme will benefit the school as it adds value in terms of
coaching ideas and resources that will help elevate our students to the
next level of football proficiency. A coherent football philosophy that
can be implemented in a developmentally appropriate way to both the B and
C division boys. The programme provides students with holistic development
beyond the football field, equipping them with the attitude, skills, and
knowledge for success in school and for overcoming the challenges they
will face in life in future.</p>
<p>JVSS football teams will play in the National School Games and other competitions
and where possible, head overseas for training stints. We have a team of
full-time coaches, both local and from La Liga, and they report to a head
coach with a FIFA 'A' licence and relevant youth development experience.
There are specialist coaches in the areas of goalkeeping, strength and
conditioning, and performance analysts. This team of coaches are overseen
by the FAS Technical Director and ActiveSG Football Academy Principal with
support from FAS Head of Methodology and AFA Technical Director. Players
will train four times a week.</p>
