<h4>Jurongville Secondary School Football Programme</h4>
<p>Jurongville Secondary School’s Football team is recognised as one of the
premier football programmes in the West. Over the years, our teams have
performed strongly in the National School Games (NSG), earning numerous
accolades in youth football and building a proud tradition of excellence
and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Rooted in Jurongville’s core values of Perseverance, Respect, Integrity,
Discipline, and Empathy (PRIDE), the football programme focuses not only
on developing our boys into skilled footballers but also on nurturing them
into responsible, resilient, and respectful young men. Discipline on and
off the field remains central to our approach, shaping players who demonstrate
commitment, teamwork, and character both during play and in daily life.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of qualified coaches and a team of dedicated teachers,
our players undergo structured and progressive training designed to balance
sporting excellence with academic growth. Besides weekly training, the
programme also includes exposure through regular friendly matches, conditioning
through fitness training sessions as well as competition experience in
National School Games (NSG) and local tournament such as the Singa Cup.</p>
<p>The Jurongville Secondary School’s Football Programme also provides opportunities
for student leadership and community engagement. Our Secondary 1 players
lead football engagement sessions for primary school students, where they
design and facilitate activities that promote teamwork, confidence, and
love for the game. This initiative builds leadership and communication
skills while strengthening our connection with the wider community.</p>
<p>The Jurongville Football Programme emphasises:</p>
