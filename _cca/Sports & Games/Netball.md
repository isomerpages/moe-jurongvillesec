<h2>Netball</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>Netball is a very popular and competitive sport in Singapore and in Jurongville,
our girls are all determined and passionate to play against other worthy
opponents from other schools. Tenacity is also much needed when we are
doing the routine physical training to level up our skills.</p>
<p>This year, we participated in the B Division zonal competition &amp; the
C Division Pool and League rounds. The new pool and league format means
that the C division team had the opportunity to play against schools across
different zones in Singapore. During the competition season, the girls
encouraged each other to do their own runs and to practice shooting on
their own.</p>
<p>Reflection is a powerful tool that the coach and teachers use to encourage
the girls to learn and improve themselves. We will continually work together
in our teams to achieve our goals.</p>

<h4>Students' voices</h4>
<p><strong>Anya Wong Jing En, B Division Captain</strong>
<br><em>Netball taught me the essence of teamwork over individual strength. It showed me that being the best is not always crucial; that effort and determination mattered the most. Our coach, who was always there to guide, imparted invaluable lessons that I'm certain the team cherishes. A message to my team mates; work diligently, play with passion, and above all, savor every step of the journey.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Tan Jia Hui, B Division Vice-Captain:</strong>
<br><em>Through Netball CCA, I have learnt to be more independent and persevering in my daily life. Netball CCA have made me physically and mentally stronger through hard work and tough trainings. The trainings might be tough but it has helped us to improve and learn many skills. I hope to develop myself further from Netball.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Aktchiyaa Chakkaravarthi, B Division Committee Member:</strong>
<br><em>Netball has been a nurturing field where I learnt important values like perseverance, hardwork, teamwork and empathy. In Netball, we faced challenges that forced us to learn to work together as one team. We have been taught to not leave anyone behind and support every single person in the team. No matter how tough the trainings were, we knew at the end of the day it was all worth it as we improved and grew.</em>
