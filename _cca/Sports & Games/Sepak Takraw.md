## Sepak Takraw

#### About

The Sepak Takraw hopes to enhance our players’ skills and develop confidence during training and competitions. It also instills the values of sportsmanship in them. Members who possess good skills and have shown good performance and discipline are chosen to represent the school.  
  
The players display determination to enhance their skills during training sessions. It also allows them to build greater camaraderie and teamwork. Our Sepak Takraw ‘B’ Division team showed their capabilities in the National Inter-School Sepak Takraw Championship and was crowned the Champions after a decade. This was not an easy feat and the boys have truly displayed the school PRIDE values.  
  
The team and teachers are appreciative to the school leaders for their strong support and guidance for the boys. The team would also like to thank Coach Said for his invaluable contributions in motivating the boys to achieve success in their endeavours.

We supported each other and motivated one another in every single game. The times when we cheered for the team and celebrated every point were my favourite moments.
