<h2>Sepak Takraw</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>The Sepak Takraw hopes to enhance our players’ skills and develop confidence
during training and competitions. It also instills the values of sportsmanship
in them. Members who possess good skills and have shown good performance
and discipline are chosen to represent the school.</p>
<p>The players display determination to enhance their skills during training
sessions. It also allows them to build greater camaraderie and teamwork.
Our Sepak Takraw ‘B’ Division team showed their capabilities in the National
Inter-School Sepak Takraw Championship and was crowned the Champions after
a decade. This was not an easy feat and the boys have truly displayed the
school PRIDE values.</p>
<p>The team and teachers are appreciative to the school leaders for their
strong support and guidance for the boys. The team would also like to thank
Coach Said for his invaluable contributions in motivating the boys to achieve
success in their endeavours.</p>

<h4>Students’ voices</h4>
<p><strong>Mohammad Haziq Akaysah Bin Abdul Rahman (4PE), Captain:</strong> 
<br><em>“I would like to encourage my juniors to keep training and never give up to achieve the Gold Medal to make the school proud. “Train so hard that one day your signature will be called an autograph” Remember, sportsmanship!”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Muhammad Darwisy Bin Rahiman (3RS), Vice-Captain:</strong> 
<br><em>“I am so proud of Jurongville Sepak Takraw B Division team. We achieved something we were not able to achieve in 10 years. We trained really hard to get the Championships Trophy. We supported each other and motivated one another in every single game. The times when we cheered for the team and celebrated every point were my favourite moments. I am so happy to be celebrating this victory alongside the seniors. I will make sure that we will continue to train and fight hard in the future.’’</em>
