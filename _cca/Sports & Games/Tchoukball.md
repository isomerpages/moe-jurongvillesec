## Tchoukball

#### About
Tchoukball has become a popular choice among the secondary schools, and we are pleased to offer it in Jurongville. It is a sport that requires players to be persistent and resilient. In our yearly pursuit to be one of the top teams in the Nationals, our players also embody the school’s PRIDE values and displayed good sportsmanship.

Our training programme is specially designed to help shape our players to grow holistically and be the PRIDE of Jurongville. Join us and let us walk the secondary school journey with you!

We are also pleased to announce that Tchoukball Association of Singapore (TBAS) is now officially part of National Sports Association (NSA) under SportsSG, as of 28 March 2023.
