## Tchoukball

#### About
Tchoukball has become a popular choice among the secondary schools and we are pleased to offer it in Jurongville. It is a sport that requires players to be persistent and resilient. In our yearly pursuit to be one of the top teams in the Nationals, our players also embody the school’s PRIDE values.  
  
Due to the unprecedented situation of Covid-19, e-CCA was conducted to engage players amidst the pandemic. While e-CCA cannot fully replicate the same learning experiences and outcomes of physical CCA training sessions, teachers and coaches worked closely to curate lesson plans and instructional resources to maximise students’ learning. Teachers hosted the synchronous CCA sessions via Google Meet and facilitated the sessions together with the coaches and leaders in the CCA. Synchronous sessions were conducted once a week and the focus was on developing togetherness, so an array of activities such as online charades and fitness training were conducted.  
  
We hope our players can grow holistically and be the PRIDE of Jurongville. Join us and let us walk the secondary school journey with you!

#### Students’ voices
**Tan Shou Jie Matthias 3PA** <br>
_During the first month of me being in charge of the CCA, I was nervous thinking whether I could handle my duties as the president of the CCA, but all the thoughts just went away after a few months as I knew that I had all my Secondary 3 friends helping me to think whenever I had no ideas for the games during the Zoom sessions. Being the president of tchoukball has taught me many things. I have learnt that whenever you face a problem that you do not know how to solve, you can always ask your friend to help. Another thing that tchoukball has helped me with is my confidence. Previously, I would not even dare to speak in front of a crowd as I did not have the courage. Tchoukball has helped me build my courage and let me speak confidently in front of the whole cca. I would always get nervous on the first training when I had to do quite a few things, but that feeling of nervousness slowly went away whenever I see the tchoukball members all joking around with me. I felt like they had made this experience fun for me._

_Being in-charge of things that I do not know how to do at first was hard and not easy for me. It helped me to overcome my sense of fear of talking to others and try to bring the team together. Now I know that teamwork, leadership and sportsmanship are needed in the role. Being a Vice-president helped me increase my knowledge of leading the team and myself forward, while working along with the teachers makes me realise that leading is not easy as it seems to be. Leading makes me realise that you need a lot of courage to be able to talk to the whole team. Tchoukball has made me realise that you need a team to achieve, win and have fun with others by working together to strive for the same thing. Seeing the team having fun together in training makes it a memorable experience for me._
