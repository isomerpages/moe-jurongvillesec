<h2>Boys' Brigade</h2><h4>About</h4><p>The 86th Boys’ Brigade (BB) is committed to nurturing our Boys to serve and lead. Every year, they are given opportunities to organise several camps such as Induction, Adventure and Leadership camps as well as to be involved in various Values-in-Action events such as BB Week, BB Cares and BB Share-a-Gift Project. Moreover, selected Boys will also be participating in the Adventure Quest and the Character Quest competitions (organised by BB HQ), where they have to undergo intensive mental and physical training prior to the competitions.</p><p>Due to the Covid-19 situation, we have scaled down our face-to-face sessions and shifted leadership development/life-skills lessons online. However, we remain committed to the objective that our Boys eventually grow to be men with obedience, reverence, self-respect and discipline.</p><h4>CCA Photo</h4><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="569" width="960" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQWrxWX9S0B9g26qOJjw_yiDQgQjxvszIPFRHtBpEMfciPUhUpII6XGK6MermOYgD8xHYyj222RHWil/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=5000"></iframe></div><h4>Student Leaders</h4><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Name</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Appointment</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Class</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ye Yonghong</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Company Sergeant Major (CSM) 2020-2021</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>4EM</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Cayden Lee</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Company Sergeant Major (CSM) 2021-2022</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3RP</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Key Achievements</h4><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>JVS</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019 Boys' Brigade Blaze (Seniors Programme) : Bronze Honour Roll</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019 Boys' Brigade Character Quest (Seniors Programme) : Bronze Honour Roll</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019 J M Fraser Year of Assessment (Bronze)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Students' voices</h4><p><strong>Staff Sergeant Ye Yonghong, CSM 2020 - 2021, Class of 4EM (2020)</strong><br><em>I would like to thank the officers, primers and squadmates for giving me the opportunity to serve the company, I am also very thankful for the support of my squadmates for the past 3 years in Boy’s Brigade and I will serve the company to the best of my ability.</em></p><h4>Training Schedule</h4><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Saturday 08:30am - 12:30pm</p></li></ul><p></p>
