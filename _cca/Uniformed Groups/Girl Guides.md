#### About

In line with Girl Guides Singapore’s mission to enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world, the Jurongville Girl Guides (1st Company) programme strives to provide a structured and holistic learning experience for every student.

In 2021, the Jurongville Girl Guides also took part in a series of activities as part of this year’s World Thinking Day celebrations aligned to the theme of ‘SDGs x Peacebuilding’. A central focus of Girl Guides Singapore, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) are the responsibility of every global citizen. A group of Girl Guides spearheaded an environmental sustainability project to encourage their schoolmates to adopt environmentally-friendly habits by recycling one-use plastic bottles. Another group of Guides also collaborated with the Secondary 1 Peer Support Leaders to conduct a series of lessons on cyberwellness during CCE periods.  

Throughout the past two years, the Guides have displayed their resilience and resourcefulness by modifying training sessions and adapting virtual tools such as videos to demonstrate footdrills and commands as the world continued to battle the Covid-19 pandemic. The girls also carried on with their learning for the 5-Point Programme through the online portal, GuidingLIGHT, and embarked on a special edition badge, the Olympia Badge, aligned with the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games. When face-to-face CCA sessions resumed, the girls embarked on a myriad of activities such as outdoor cooking, tent-pitching, and Free Being Me sessions, a body positivity programme in conjunction with Dove. 

An international movement, Girl Guiding remains committed to honing every girl’s global awareness and sense of place in the/her world. It is hoped that every Girl Guide develops empathy and ingenuity, steps out of her comfort zone, and ultimately rises up to meet the challenges of the VUCA world.
