<p>The Guiding experience at Jurongville is a structured and holistic one,
where our girls are enriched and challenged beyond their comfort zones
through an array of activities and initiatives. Through our 4 year programme,
Guides are equipped with critical skills to navigate an increasingly complex
world and make a difference in their own communities. Importantly, Guides
get to forge lifelong friendships!</p>

<p>The past couple of years have seen significant milestones for the Company.
From 2021 to 2024, our unit was proud to achieve the Puan Noor Aishah Award
(PNAA) in Gold, and in 2025, we attained the Silver award—an affirmation
of our commitment to service, leadership, and development of every single
Guide. Our Guides actively participated in Girl Guides Singapore (GGS)
initiatives such as the Free Being Me programme, promoting positive self-image,
and the Friends of Singa project, which fosters kindness and active citizenry.
In addition, our annual cookie sale provides valuable opportunities for
the girls to develop confidence and communication skills while engaging
the school community.</p>

<p>Experiential learning and collaboration are key tenets of the Guiding
experience. Our annual training camps provide a safe and supportive environment
for our Guides to complete a range of teambuilding, leadership and outdoor
adventure activities. Our Guides hone practical outdoor skills like tent-pitching
and outdoor cooking through learning from their peers from River Valley
Girl Guides, and take the lead in environmental efforts through school-wide
recycling initiatives. Our members have also proudly represented the school
at national events, including the National Day Parade. These experiences
not only build resilience and teamwork but also empower our girls to be
confident leaders who serve with purpose.</p>

<p>As proud members of a wider international movement, Jurongville Girl Guides
remains committed to honing every girl’s global awareness and sense of
place in the/her world. It is hoped that each Guide develops empathy and
critical awareness, steps out of her comfort zone, and ultimately rises
up to meet the challenges of today's world.</p>
