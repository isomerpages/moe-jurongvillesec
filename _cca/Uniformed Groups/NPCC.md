<h2>NPCC</h2>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), formed in 1959, is one of the
longest standing uniformed youth organisations in Singapore today with
a proud heritage.</p>
<p>Its popularity amongst our youth is largely attributed to its close affiliation
with the Singapore Police Force. Our cadets are exposed to unique opportunities
to gain knowledge and familiarity with Singapore’s crime prevention efforts
in building a safe and secure home for us all.</p>
<p>Through a variety of activities, the values of resilience, integrity,
service, and excellence are inculcated in our youth. These values will
enable them to develop into caring and responsible citizens with a sense
of purpose to serve the community.</p>
<p>NPCC is a fulfilling and enriching co-curricular activity which allows
cadets to learn and grow significantly in personal competencies and leadership.
The Corps also continually seeks to improve and craft rich and meaningful
learning experiences to equip our cadets with the necessary skill sets
to navigate the world of the 21st centuryz.</p>

<h4>Students’ voices</h4>
<p><strong>SGT(NPCC) NG TZE HENG, Chairperson (2024 - 2025):</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Being part of NPCC was one of my most memorable experiences in secondary school. When I first started, I was very shy and lacked the confidence. NPCC has nurtured me to my fullest potential which I am grateful for. I formed many great bonds with my squad mates and attained many values such as resilience and discipline. The courses were very beneficial and I can apply the values I learnt in my daily life. I was given the honour to be Chairperson of Jurongville NPCC which was very surprising as I didn’t expect that I have come this far too. I am proud that my NPCC experience in Jurongville Sec is one of my greatest accomplishments of all time.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>SGT(NPCC) NUR QAISARA BINTE MUHAMMAD ' ADLI, Vice-Chairperson (2024 - 2025):</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Joining JVS NPCC has taught me a lot of skills and I gained experiences that will allow me to harness what I want to be in the future. I was interested in how the Singapore Police Force keeps Singapore and the citizens safe. JVS NPCC provided me many opportunities to learn how the SPF is able to do their duties diligently. Activities like Crime Scene Investigation Courses and the Police Youth Ambassador project have allowed me to obtain certain skills that I can use so that I can become what I aspire to be in the future.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>SGT(NPCC) ANG KENG HENG ZABRIEL, Vice-Chairperson (2024 - 2025):</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Joining JVS NPCC has been a very enlightening and fun experience for me. I remember when I first joined the CCA, I was scared. As time went by, I realised how close knit everyone was. The teachers and seniors made me feel very comfortable and learning alongside my seniors taught me values like discipline and perseverance. NPCC provided many opportunities for me to grow and learn many new skills, skills that would be highly beneficial to me in the future. There was never a dull moment in JVS NPCC and I am forever grateful for all that they have done for me.</em>
