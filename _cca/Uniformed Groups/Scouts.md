## Scouts

#### About
“Be Prepared!” All Scouts live by this motto. For Scouts, the world is their classroom, as they go through a diverse and exciting set of activities that includes campcraft, orienteering, kayaking, and survival skills. Through these experiences, Scouts gain invaluable life experiences and get a chance to push themselves out of their comfort zones.  
  
Scouts contribute to society yearly through programmes such as Scouting It Forward, a programme for Scouts to volunteer their services to those around them in exchange for donations. This teaches them the value of hard work, as well as the concept of dignity of labour. Scouts also participate regularly in projects and campaigns that educate them on various societal and environmental issues, such as those organised by the National Crime Prevention Council and the Singapore Kindness Movement.  
  
As of September 2021, the Jurongville Gryphon Scouts Troop has achieved the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award for the 10th consecutive year. This is a testament to the combined efforts of all the teachers, students, and alumni who have contributed to the Troop’s success over the past decade!

#### Students’ voices
**Siow Yi Xiang, Caden (3IN), Troop Leader:** <br>
_From Scouts, I’ve picked up some moral values that helped to shape me into the person I am today. I think that Scouts tends to be viewed by others as a CCA that’s just all about tying knots, but in fact if you fully participate in it, you would realise that it is more than that in so many ways. It teaches us moral values, and we learn the correct way to lead and to apply problem-solving skills.  
Definitely the most fun and memorable activities for me were the mid-year and end-of-year camps. Even with the COVID restrictions, it could not have been more memorable and I still get juniors talking about and asking me questions about what we did at camp!_  
  
**Lee Yan Ze Clement (3DP), Patrol Leader:** <br>
_One thing I learnt during Scouts was how to tie various kinds of knots, such as the square lashing and round turn with two half hitches. I also learnt to be more considerate and disciplined as part of the Scouts Law, and I learnt to apply this in my everyday life. Though we no longer have Job Week Camps due to COVID, I also appreciated being able to help many people in the nearby neighbourhoods and at the same time, earn money for my Scouts fund._

**Ling Jia He (3DP), Patrol Leader:** <br>
_One thing I learnt during my time in Scouts is the importance of responsibility. During Secondary 2 when we were still leaders-in-training, we were given a task to plan activities for training. This taught me to be a better planner, to consider objectives to be met, and planning activities to fulfil the objectives. One activity I found fun during my time in Scouts was definitely Job Week Camp! We went around "working" by offering services like cleaning and we got to have fun with our fellow Scouts. The money earned would go to our Scout Troop fund so that it could help fund our Scouting activities, such as our archery tag bonding sessions and our year-end camps._
