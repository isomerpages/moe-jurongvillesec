**_Hark was a student of Jurongville Secondary School from 2017 to 2020. During his time in JVSS, he was an active member of the school’s Infocomm Club, and taught many of his juniors the basics of video-taking as the Club’s Head of Videography. As of 2021, he is currently pursuing his A-Levels at Anderson-Serangoon Junior College (ASJC). Hark was one of our top O-Level students in 2020._**

**What did you find most memorable about your time in JVSS?**<br>
I greatly enjoyed my time at Jurongville during my four years there! The most memorable period for me would be the weeks leading up to my O-Level examinations. It was hectic and stressful but I’m glad I managed to persevere through it.

**In your opinion, what are the best things about JVSS?**<br>
The teachers at JVSS were extremely helpful and I was able to ask for help from them at any time! Messages and requests for consultation were replied to immediately and I was always able to receive the guidance and support I needed, no matter when I needed it. In addition, I also feel that the environment at JVSS was a very conducive and supportive one. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to improve and better myself as a person while studying there.

**What was one thing you learnt in your four years at JVSS?**<br>
I learnt that we are in charge of our own learning. No one can decide for us whether we want to learn or not and our progress is solely determined by how much effort we put into our studies. I wasn’t a really hardworking student at the start and would spend a lot of time playing around and giving my teachers a giant headache. However, it was indubitable that my grades were affected and I was not doing the best academically. It made me realise I had to cultivate a better work ethic when I was preparing for the O-Levels, and I aimed to be a more conscientious individual so that I could achieve better grades.  

**What are some words of advice you would like to give to your juniors?**<br>
Have fun with your days in school but don’t slack too much. Make sure you get a good balance of play and study. Most importantly, put effort into what matters to you and make sure you do it well.

**_Xue’er graduated from JVSS in 2020, having been a student of Jurongville Secondary School since 2017. She was an active member of the school’s Chinese Orchestra, and played in many events both in and out of school during her four years here. She is currently an A-Level student at National Junior College (NJC). Xue’er was one of our top O-Level students in 2020._**

**During your time in JVSS, you were part of the school’s Chinese Orchestra. Which are the most memorable events you played at?**<br>
At JVSS, I had many opportunities to take part in activities ranging from small inter-class events to large-scale international events. But the events I would say were the most memorable were the times when I took part in SYF, which happened twice in my four years as a secondary school student.

**What are some of the things you learnt from participating in SYF, then?**<br>
I learnt about how we have to manage our stress levels well, as preparing for such events can be a nerve-racking experience. I also learnt how to interact and work together with people with differing personalities, and realised that it’s really important to surround yourself with people whom you can rely on, as these people will become your pillar of support throughout this stressful process!

**Aside from your CCA activities, were there any other events or activities you took part in during your time in JVSS that have had a lasting impact on you?**<br>
I remember that as part of the Class Committee Executive Committee, I had to give presentations to various classes and student leaders in support of the Student Suggestion Drive in 2019. Preparing for the presentations helped me learn how best to stay calm when doing public speaking, which will stand me in good stead in the future.

Aside from that, I also went on an Overseas Service Learning (OSL) trip to Chiang Mai in 2019. There, I learnt that it is necessary to trust and help the people I work with to ensure everyone’s success.

**Lastly, what are some of the most important things you’ve learnt at JVSS?**<br>
During the four years I’ve spent here, I’ve grown not just academically, but also gained many skills I can put to good use in the future. For instance, I’ve learnt to think quickly and analyse problems systematically to try and solve them. Even though many may think school is just for academic pursuits, I had various opportunities to do other types of activities as well! I don’t think these four years could have been spent in a better way. Therefore, I can conclusively say that my school life in JVSS was great!
