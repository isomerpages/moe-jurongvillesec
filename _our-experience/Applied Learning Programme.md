## Applied Learning Programme&nbsp;

#### Preparing Students for a SMART Nation and World
Imagine everyday living eased in by technology. You live in smart homes with automated processes. It becomes a norm in the world for drones to navigate between places and deliver parcels. A smart nation and world are no longer dreams, but reality in the near future. We can and should seize opportunities to thrive in the future.

#### STEM ALP in Action
Jurongville Secondary School prides itself in offering STEM Applied Learning Programme, “Real-World Learning Through Electronics”. All students receive opportunities to learn electronics and apply their learning in real-world settings. 

Secondary One and Two students are exposed to the fundamentals of electronics and coding through drone flying activities and learn to control robots using block programing. They learn the basics of how to create their own online games and have hands on opportunities to learn and apply what they have learnt.

Upper Secondary students have the opportunity to specialise in programmes that suit their strengths and interests. These include taking up the O-level Applied Subject, “Electronics”, ITE Applied Subject, “Smart Electrical Technology” or applying for a short-term Applied Learning Modules at Polytechnics (APLM) on Electronics.
Some of the students even had the opportunity to share what they have learnt in STEM ALP lessons with friends in Dripstone Middle School in Darwin Australia.
