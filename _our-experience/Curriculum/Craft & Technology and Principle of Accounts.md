## Craft &amp; Technology / Principle of Accounts

#### Art

Learning Art as a discipline will help students better relate themselves to the world around them. The Art programme aims to nurture artistic dispositions, critical thinkers and confident students who are able to appreciate and respond to works of art, as well as create and express themselves through the creative use of materials, techniques, and technology. Students will acquire a strong foundation in art and process skills through exposure, experimentation and learning experience beyond school.

The Personal Learning Devices (PLD) has truly enhanced our art classrooms, unlocking endless possibilities. By meaningfully integrating technology into our art curriculum, we are able to create digital art using new-tech tools, find inspirations through online research, share ideas and collaborate more effectively.

Using both traditional and modern tools, our students are able to deepen their learning, maximise their enjoyment and engagement as we make learning relevant and more meaningful.

#### Design and Technology (D&amp;T)

The Design and Technology (D&amp;T) teaching and learning syllabus is for all levels from lower to upper secondary.

In D&amp;T, students learn mainly through design-and-make projects guided by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and realising the design solution; with research carried out when necessary. Research includes testing ideas through quick mock-ups and evaluating the final design solution with the intended user. In doing so, pupils acquire relating knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into reality and values like mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity in the are of social, culture and environment.

D&amp;T education aims to nurture in our pupils a way of thinking and doing – designerly dispositions that are inherent in design practices – through designing and making. The designerly dispositions are as follows:
* Embracing uncertainties and complexities
* Be cognizant of and resolve real-world, ill-defined problems
* Relentless drive to seek out how things work
* Use of doodling and sketching, and 3D manipulation of resistant materials as a language for visualisation, communication and presentation.

This year, three teams of Secondary 3 students participated in the Innovation, Design and Engineering Challenge on 21 May 2024 at F1 Pit Building. The aim of the competition is to challenge students on problem solving skills across domains such as electronics, programming and mechanical design. 

By learning problem-solving skills across these domains, students develop interdisciplinary thinking, creativity, effective collaboration and the ability to tackle complex projects. These skills equip students for careers in product development, innovation, and engineering, enabling them to tackle real-world challenges and drive technological advancements. Our students have been awarded with the Innovation Award.

#### Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)

Our subject aims to develop students’ understanding of the relationship between nutrition and health, consumer literacy and food science. Students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to be health ambassadors, discerning consumers, and food innovators. 

With the resumption of school enrichment programmes this year, NFS students had the opportunity to learn the science and art of Pao-making through a workshop conducted by professional chefs. Our graduating NFS students also participated in the “I Scream for Ice-Cream workshop” at the Singapore Science Centre, where they learnt to apply the concepts of food science in ice-cream making.

This year, teachers from the NFS unit and Humanities department came together to learn from each other’s curriculum and participate in a workshop to make food enzymes and food products from food waste.

Our unit continued to collaborate with various stakeholders to promote healthy eating for all students and staff. A termly Fruit Day was carried out to instill the habit of consuming two servings of fruits a day.

#### Principles of Accounts (POA)

The POA curriculum provides students with a basic introduction to financial accounting.  Students will develop an appreciation of the discipline of accounting and the need for ethical conduct in this field.  Accounting students will develop the abilities to  prepare, communicate and use the financial information for decision-making.  They will be trained to be logical, systematic and analytical, while  being imbued with values such as integrity, objectivity and discipline.
