#### Art

Learning Art as a discipline will help students better relate themselves to the world around them. The Art programme aims to nurture artistic dispositions, critical thinkers and confident students who are able to appreciate and respond to works of art, as well as create and express themselves through the creative use of materials, techniques, and technology. Students will acquire a strong foundation in art and process skills through exposure, experimentation and learning experience beyond school. 

The Personal Learning Devices (PLD) has truly enhanced our art classrooms, unlocking endless possibilities. By meaningfully integrating technology into our art curriculum, we are able to create digital art using new-tech tools, find inspirations through online research, share ideas and collaborate more effectively.
 
Using both traditional and modern tools, our students are able to deepen their learning, maximise their enjoyment and engagement as we make learning relevant and more meaningful.

#### Design and Technology (D&amp;T)

The D&T curriculum emphasises on educating our students through innovation and the development of cognitive skills and abilities unique in the field of design to solve real-life problems.

As early as in Secondary One, students have the opportunity to design and create individual products from various materials such as plastic, wood and metal. Students are also introduced to the essential and authentic new technologies used in the working world.

Lower secondary students are taught to design and make their personal functional products through design processes, namely the Penlite project for Secondary One and the Handphone holder project for Secondary Two.

Students were also given the opportunity to participate in the Toy Design competition organised by Singapore Polytechnic. They were tasked to design a cam toy based on the theme “Life during COVID-19”. Applying what they have learnt about mechanism and producing their original cam toy design, our students have achieved the Commendation Award.

#### Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)

Our subject aims to develop students’ understanding of the relationship between nutrition and health, consumer literacy and food science. Students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to be health ambassadors, discerning consumers, and food innovators. 

With the resumption of school enrichment programmes this year, NFS students had the opportunity to learn the science and art of Pao-making through a workshop conducted by professional chefs. Our graduating NFS students also participated in the “I Scream for Ice-Cream workshop” at the Singapore Science Centre, where they learnt to apply the concepts of food science in ice-cream making.

This year, teachers from the NFS unit and Humanities department came together to learn from each other’s curriculum and participate in a workshop to make food enzymes and food products from food waste.

Our unit continued to collaborate with various stakeholders to promote healthy eating for all students and staff. A termly Fruit Day was carried out to instill the habit of consuming two servings of fruits a day.

#### Principles of Accounts (POA)

The POA curriculum provides students with a basic introduction to financial accounting.  Students will develop an appreciation of the discipline of accounting and the need for ethical conduct in this field.  Accounting students will develop the abilities to  prepare, communicate and use the financial information for decision-making.  They will be trained to be logical, systematic and analytical, while  being imbued with values such as integrity, objectivity and discipline.
