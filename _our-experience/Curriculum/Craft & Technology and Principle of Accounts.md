#### Art

Learning Art as a discipline will help students better relate themselves to the world around them. The Art programme aims to nurture artistic dispositions, critical thinkers and confident students who are able to appreciate and respond to works of art, as well as create and express themselves through the creative use of materials, techniques, and technology. Students will acquire a strong foundation in art and process skills through exposure, experimentation and learning experience beyond school.Â 

The Personal Learning Devices (PLD) has truly enhanced our art classrooms, unlocking endless possibilities. By meaningfully integrating technology into our art curriculum, we are able to create digital art using new-tech tools, find inspirations through online research, share ideas and collaborate more effectively.

Using both traditional and modern tools, our students are able to deepen their learning, maximise their enjoyment and engagement as we make learning relevant and more meaningful.
