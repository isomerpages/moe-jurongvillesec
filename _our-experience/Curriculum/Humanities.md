## Humanities

#### Department Goals

To cultivate passionate and resilient Humanities learners who think critically, care deeply, and act responsibly

#### Nurturing Passionate Learners

Humanities lessons offer authentic, inquiry-driven experiences that build curiosity, competence, critical thinking, and ownership. Through real-world issues, progressive disciplinary skills, student choice, and opportunities such as fieldwork, exhibitions, and service learning, students see relevance and develop deeper engagement. A culture of visible thinking, reflection, and formative feedback further strengthens their confidence, analytical rigour, and motivation as active, self-directed Humanities learners.

#### Growing Leaders
Leaders are developed through structured opportunities that allow students to analyse complex issues, make informed decisions, and take responsible action across diverse, authentic contexts. Through roles in inquiry projects and student-led discussions, learning showcases, and community or national platforms, students practise communication, collaboration, and ethical reasoning. With progressive scaffolds and reflective routines, they develop the confidence, empathy, and civic-mindedness to lead with clarity and purpose, and to care deeply for the people and communities they influence.

#### Empowering World-Ready Stewards
By engaging students in inquiry, fieldwork, and community-centred learning, they are equipped to navigate real-world issues, understand global trends, and appreciate local–global interconnections, fostering the development of world-ready stewards. Through the cultivation of critical discernment, ethical awareness, and respect for diverse perspectives, students learn to evaluate the impact of decisions on societies and the environment. Authentic tasks—such as issue investigations, dialogues with communities, and applied digital-civic practices—further prepare them to act responsibly and sustainably. In this way, the department nurtures students who are ready to contribute thoughtfully and constructively to an increasingly complex and interconnected world.

#### Inspiring Lifelong Humanities Learners
Building on the work in nurturing passionate learners, growing leaders, and empowering world-ready stewards, the Humanities Department aims to cultivate curiosity, critical thinking, and a love for learning that extends beyond school. Students are encouraged to continue exploring, reflecting, and engaging with the world as informed, empathetic, and responsible individuals throughout their lives.
