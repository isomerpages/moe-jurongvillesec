## Mother Tongue Languages

This year, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department focused on making the learning of Mother Tongue languages relevant, meaningful and contemporary. We designed our teaching and learning (T&amp;L) of MTL to be digitally engaging as all our students are equipped with personal learning devices. We leveraged on e-pedagogy and the application of technology to engage our students through learner-centred approaches.

Reading becomes more significant in our T&amp;L as we strive to develop our students to be discerning readers with a love for reading. Hence, our new look programme aims to cultivate the reading habits of our students for them to be lifelong learners beyond school. In addition, journal writing plays a significant role in our T&amp;L. Our students are tasked to write and reflect on their thoughts, feelings and life experiences. They also hone their communications skills by sharing their comments or views either online and/or in class.

#### Our Achievements

##### National Schools Xinyao Singing and Songwriting Competition
Our Qing Qing Xuan Maidens, a girl group comprising of Fidelia Lo Miao Ting (2RP), Ngu Yi Jeanne (2DP) and Karis Goh (2DP, took part in the National Schools Xinyao Singing and Songwriting Competition 2022.

Overcoming challenges with positivity and resilience, the effort invested by the girls over the two months paid off handsomely. They emerged as one of the top 5 choral groups in the grand finale after winning the judges’ nod of approval.

##### Naanum Oru Padaippaali
‘Naanum Oru Padaippaali’ was organised by the Ministry of Education with the aim of nurturing in students the passion to produce creative literary works of commendable sophistication.

Under the ‘Budding Artistes’ category, our students were trained on the fundamentals of short story writing. The skills acquired during the workshops were translated into creative pieces of work that had undergone 3 rounds of selection, alongside those of their peers from 15 other secondary schools.

To much joy, our students Veeramahendran Amirtha (3IN), Thambi Durai Sherin (3RS) and Ramanathan Abinaya (2IN) were recipients of the ‘Best Budding Artistes’ awards and had their hard work showcased during the Prize Presentation Ceremony.
