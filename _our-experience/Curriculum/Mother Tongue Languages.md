## Mother Tongue Languages

This year, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department focused on making the learning of Mother Tongue languages relevant, meaningful and contemporary. We designed our teaching and learning (T&amp;L) of MTL to be digitally engaging as all our students are equipped with personal learning devices. We leveraged on e-pedagogy and the application of technology to engage our students through learner-centred approaches.

Reading becomes more significant in our T&amp;L as we strive to develop our students to be discerning readers with a love for reading. Hence, our new look programme aims to cultivate the reading habits of our students for them to be lifelong learners beyond school. In addition, journal writing plays a significant role in our T&amp;L. Our students are tasked to write and reflect on their thoughts, feelings and life experiences. They also hone their communications skills by sharing their comments or views either online and/or in class.
