## Mother Tongue Languages

<img src="/images/mother tongue languages department 2.jpg" style="width:85%">

This year, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department focused on making the learning of Mother Tongue languages relevant, meaningful and contemporary.  We designed our teaching and learning (T&L) of MTL to be digitally engaging as all our students are equipped with personal learning devices.  We leveraged on e-pedagogy and the application of technology to engage our students through learner-centred approaches.

Reading becomes more significant in our T&L as we strive to develop our students to be discerning readers with a love for reading.  Hence, our new look programme aims to cultivate the reading habits of our students for them to be lifelong learners beyond school. In addition, journal writing plays a significant role in our T&L. Our students are tasked to write and reflect on their thoughts, feelings and life experiences.  They also hone their communications skills by sharing their comments or views either online and/or in class.
