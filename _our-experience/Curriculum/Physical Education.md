#### Physical Education

The Physical Education Department in JVS aims to expose JVnites to a myriad number of sports, Outdoor Education and Physical Health Fitness programmes so that at the end of their secondary school experiences, they are equipped with the necessary skills to keep fit and healthy.

Apart from the PE Curriculum, JVS PE Department offers JVS Olympics to all Secondary 1 to 3 students during the post exam activities and the Annual Run (Beep Test for 2022). The Beep Test&nbsp; was an innovative move as we were still in the pandemic stages in the beginning of 2022. Nevertheless, the students were encouraged and gave their best during the challenge!
