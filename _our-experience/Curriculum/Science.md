## Science

#### Learning of Science
At Jurongville Secondary School, our Science Department is dedicated to fostering a deep understanding and appreciation in the Practices of Science. Our curriculum is designed to engage students in hands-on, inquiry-based learning experiences that encourage critical thinking, problem-solving and a passion for discovery. Together with studentsâ€™ Personal Learning Devices (PLD), we allow students to learn together and harness the interactive and multimodal features of digital technology.

#### Our Vision
To inspire and cultivate scientifically literate students who are curious about the world around them and equipped with the skills to explore, analyse and contribute to the ever-evolving field of science.

#### Our Approach
We believe that science is best learned by doing. We encourage active learning where students are not just passive recipients of information but active participants in the learning process. Through experiments, projects and real-world applications, students develop a strong foundation in scientific principles and practices.

Where possible, we expose our students to see beyond the classroom through learning journeys that help students to see and learn beyond the classroom.

#### Our Curriculum
Our comprehensive science curriculum spans across Biology, Chemistry and Physics. It is carefully crafted to demonstrate ways of thinking and doing in Science. Students will investigate scientific phenomenon, evaluate and develop explanations and solutions where they will make more informed decisions before taking responsible actions.

#### Science Talent and Research Programme (STaR)
Beyond the classroom, we offer the STaR programme to allow students to explore their scientific interests further. Competitive events, Olympiads and learning journeys to institutions and industry sites are some of the experiences Our STaR students will be having to broaden their horizons and provide them with unique opportunities to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts.

Our STaR team was one of top 20 schools in Singapore who participated in the NXplorers competition organised by SHELL. In addition, our students also achieved Silver and Bronze awards in the Singapore Junior Biology and Chemistry Olympiad.
