## Science

#### Learning of Science
Science is a systematic way of thinking that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. Besides doing the exciting experiments that students do in the science laboratories, they are also engaged in Inquiry Based Learning where concepts are not taught but discovered. Together with the studentsâ€™ Personal Learning Devices (PLD), learning becomes efficient and engaging.

#### Science Talent and Research Programme (STaR)
Students who are interested and aspire to deepen their learning in Science are given the opportunity to be part of the Science Talent and Research (STaR) programme. Students on this programme are exposed to Science learning beyond what is taught in the school curriculum. This enrichment is achieved through school-based projects, learning journeys and participating in competitions. Our STaR team was one of 20 schools in Singapore who participated in the NXplorers competition organised by SHELL. In addition, two students achieved the silver and bronze awards in the Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad.
