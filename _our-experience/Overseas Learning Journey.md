## Overseas Learning Journey

As part of our schoolâ€™s effort to develop in our students the 21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills, as well as deepen their commitment and rootedness to Singapore, the school have organised the following overseas cultural immersion trips in 2019.

1 \. Overseas Community Involvement Project at Tanjung Pinang (Indonesia)<br>
2 \. Overseas Service Learning at Chiang Mai (Thailand)<br>
3 \. Cultural Immersion at Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam)<br>
4 \. Sports Twinning at Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia)<br>
5 \. Twinning programme at Tianjin (China)

All students are given the opportunity to embark on at least one overseas trip during their time in Jurongville Secondary School, contributing to a dynamic student learning experience that takes place beyond their classrooms.
