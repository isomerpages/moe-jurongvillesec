### General School Information
<h5><b><u>General discipline/school routine matters</u></b></h5>
Discipline is one of our school values. Our school believes that when our students learn to be more disciplined, they think and act in more responsible and considerate ways. To influence the students’ character development through discipline, we believe in Discipline with Care. 

More information can be found at the link below:

<h5><b><u>Handphone Policy</u></b></h5>
Students who bring their handphones to school will need to put them in their personal lockers in the classrooms. The handphones cannot be used during curriculum time and recess breaks. This will allow students to focus on their learning and their interaction with their peers and teachers. 

Students can only use their handphones after the end of all lessons in the afternoon. 

<h5><b><u>Counselling and Other Support for Students</u></b></h5>

<h5><b><u>ICT Matters for Students And Parents</u></b></h5>

•	<b><u>Personal Learning Device</u></b><br>
As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), all Sec 1 students will own a Chrome book as their Personal Learning Device (PLD). Students are to purchase their PLD through the school to ensure compatibility and security.  Jurongville Secondary School will leverage this opportunity to enhance the learning experiences of our students. Through the meaningful use of technology, we hope that our students will
<ul>
	<li><b>L</b>earn More Actively,</li>
	<li><b>T</b>hink More Deeply, and</li>
	<li><b>E</b>xperience More Joy and Success in school. </li>
</ul>

To reduce out-of-pocket cash from students, Singapore citizen students can use their Edusave account to pay for the PLD. For students on financial assistance, further subsidies will be provided. The purchase of the device will be done through the school. More information will be provided for students and parents in January 2023.

<h5><b><u>Secondary-Level Student Smart Card (SSC)</u></b></h5>

The new Secondary-Level SSC will be issued at a later date. While Secondary One students are waiting for their Secondary-level SSCs to be ready, they can continue to use their Primary-level SSCs for concessionary travel till end-April 2022. Students can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary-level SSCs. However, students would need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.

<h5><b><u>Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App</u></b></h5>

In the next 4 or 5 years, the school will be communicating with parents on administrative matters largely through the Parents Gateway App. Therefore, it is important for all parents to download and use the App, if they have not already done so before. 

Parents Gateway is a mobile application (or “app”) that connects parents and schools on key administrative matters, providing schools with the platform to send updates on programmes and activities to parents. At the same time, Parents Gateway allows parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities and declaring travel plans. It aims to aggregate parent-teacher communications securely on a centralised digital platform. Access to Parents Gateway is granted to parents, legal guardians and authorised caregivers of students studying in MOE schools in Singapore. Parents will need to use SingPass to access Parents Gateway.
