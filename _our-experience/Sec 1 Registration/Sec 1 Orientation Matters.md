### Sec 1 Orientation Matters

<b><u>Secondary 1 Orientation (2 to 5 January 2024)</u></b>

Progressing on to secondary school is a major transition for all students. To help the Secondary 1 students adapt more quickly to our school, the Student Councillors have organised an Orientation Programme from 2 to 5 January 2024. The Orientation Programme will allow the students to make new friends, interact with their Class Mentors (form teachers) and understand what is expected of them as JV-nites.

In the event that the JVS PE attire is not yet available, you may report in your primary school PE attire. 

On the first day of school, there will be signages to provide direction for Secondary 1 Students to report to the school hall. Student Councillors will also be around to guide our Secondary 1 JV-nites.

To help you understand our school better, and for us to have a chance to meet up with you, the school is inviting all parents to attend a parent engagement on <b>5 January 2024, Friday, from 4.30 pm to 7.30 pm.</b> This will coincide with the finale of your child’s/ward’s Orientation Programme.

The Parent Engagement Day will include an overview of the school’s direction and key programmes, and what your child/ward can look forward to in the next 4 or 5 years in JVS. Please indicate your attendance for this event when your child/ward completes the registration form.

<h4><b><u>JVS CCA Engagement Programme</u></b></h4>

Co-Curricular Activities in secondary school provides students with experiences to develop CCA-specific skills, relationship building and leadership competencies, through sustained participation in the four/ five years in Jurongville Secondary School. As such, our Secondary 1 students will explore and experience some of the CCA activities in the first few weeks of school before indicating their CCA preferences. 

The following is an overview of the CCA 1st week Orientation Experience.
