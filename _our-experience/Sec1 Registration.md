### Principal's Address
Dear Students and Parents/Guardians,

On behalf of all of us here at Jurongville Secondary School, welcome!  

We are very happy and excited that you are joining us. We hope that you will soon consider Jurongville as your second home, just as how your primary school was like for you in the last 6 years.  

We understand that transiting to a new school environment can be scary. In the first week of January, you will have the opportunity to make new friends and meet new teachers. Your seniors have been preparing for the Sec 1 Orientation, especially for you during this school holiday. During the Orientation, you will also be able to try your hands at all CCAs we have here; you will then be given the opportunity to indicate your preferred CCA choices. It will be a busy few months ahead, adapting to an exciting stage in your life. 

In the meantime, from Wednesday, 20 December 2023 onwards, you and your parents will be busy getting new books, new school uniforms and PE attire for next year. **We strongly encourage you to make these purchases online.** Information about the sale of books and school uniform can be found under “S1 Registration Matters”. 

Students who have already received the approval for 2024 MOE FAS from their Primary Schools are to obtain a set of letters from our General Office before they proceed to the bookstore and uniform vendors to make the necessary purchases. Students who are eligible for MOE Financial Assistance and have not made any applications with their Primary Schools, can apply for it as soon as you have received your Sec 1 posting results. When approved, these books and uniforms will be provided to you.

My Colleagues and I look forward to seeing you and sharing more about our school on Tuesday 2nd January 2024.

Till then, I’d like to take the opportunity to wish you and your loved ones a very merry Christmas and a fantastic start to the new year.  

Sincerely,
Philibert Leow
Principal
