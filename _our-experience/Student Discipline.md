## Student Discipline

#### Approach to Student Discipline
Discipline is one of our school values. Our school believes that when our students learn to be more disciplined, they think and act in more responsible and considerate ways. Responsible and considerate behaviour, in turn, contribute to a conducive learning environment.  
  
When our students consistently make the decision to do the right thing without being told to do so, and are guided by the right values in their decision-making process, they begin to exercise self-discipline. When our students are self-disciplined, they will succeed in whatever they choose to excel.  
  
To influence the students’ character development through discipline, we believe in the need to discipline with care. Guided by this philosophy, the school will:  

*   Demonstrate care by having high expectations of our students
*   Demonstrate care by affirming our students when they make responsible decisions and behave appropriately
*   Demonstrate care by providing support and useful feedback to students when they have behaved irresponsibly or in an inconsiderate manner
*   Demonstrate care by helping students to learn about responsible behaviour through appropriate disciplinary consequences

#### School Rules and Regulations
Students of Jurongville are expected to respect the school rules and regulations. These rules and regulations allow all students to learn in a safe, respectful and orderly environment.  
  
When deciding the appropriate disciplinary consequences, the school will consider the seriousness of the offence. Parents will be informed when students are disciplined. They may be requested to meet the staff of the school depending on the offence. This will allow the school to support the students’ change in behaviour through our partnership with the parents.
  
If students continually and persistently break the school rules, despite the support and care of the school staff, they may be suspended or expelled from school.  
  
To remind students of their responsibilities in relation to the school rules and regulations, students should refer to the following **ABC Expectations:**  

**A** – Appearance. Accept all school rules regarding hair style, personal grooming, school uniform, PE attire and shoes as you are a student of Jurongville.  
**B** – Behaviour. Behave in a responsible manner as required by the school rules and our national laws. Make your behaviour a source of pride for your family and friends.  
**C** – Commitment. Commit to doing the right thing all the time. Start by coming to school punctually and regularly. Make it your habit to do the right thing.
