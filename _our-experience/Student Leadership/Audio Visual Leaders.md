<h3>Audio-Visual Leaders</h3>
<p>In Jurongville Secondary School, our Audio-Visual Leaders play a crucial
role in ensuring the smooth execution of school events and activities by
managing all technical and media aspects. These student leaders are responsible
for operating audio-visual equipment and supporting the school’s technological
needs, fostering a well-organised and dynamic environment for various programmes.</p>
<p>Audio-Visual Leaders are key contributors to the success of school events,
performances and daily operations. Their responsibilities extend beyond
technical expertise, as they collaborate with staff and other student leaders
to ensure that all equipment functions optimally, contributing to the school’s
vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Being an Audio-Visual Leader provides student leaders with a platform
to develop both technical and leadership skills. Audio-Visual Leaders are
trained not only in the use of technical equipment but also in communication,
teamwork and event planning.</p>

<p>Key areas of development include:</p>
