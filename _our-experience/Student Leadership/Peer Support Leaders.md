<h3>Peer Support Leaders</h3>
<p>In Jurongville Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders play a crucial
role in fostering a caring and inclusive environment where every student
feels supported and valued. As advocates for student well-being, they work
to create a strong sense of belonging and ensure that no student is left
behind. This is aligned with our school vision as a nurturing community
in which our students feel safe, cared for and flourish.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility of a Peer Support Leader is to provide emotional
and social support to their fellow students. They are trained to offer
a listening ear, identify students who may be struggling and guide them
towards the help they need. Through their role, PSLs encourage positive
peer relationships and contribute to a harmonious and inclusive school
environment.</p>
