## Sports Leaders

In Jurongville Secondary School, our Sports Leaders play a vital role in promoting a culture of active living, teamwork and sportsmanship among their peers. As ambassadors of health and physical well-being, they are responsible for organising, leading and inspiring others to participate in sports activities and maintain an active lifestyle.

Sports Leaders are selected for their passion for sports, leadership qualities and dedication to promoting physical activities within the school. They are role models, encouraging participation in sports, assisting teachers in managing events and helping to nurture a love for physical fitness among students.

Jurongville’s Sports Leaders receive leadership training that prepares them to take on the challenges of leading their peers in various sports-related activities. Some key aspects of their development include:
* Event management skills: Learning how to plan, organise and execute sports events, managing everything from logistics to participant engagement.
* Team-building and Leadership Workshops: These workshops help Sports Leaders build the skills they need to motivate others, resolve conflicts and lead teams effectively.
* Communication and Public Speaking: As leaders of sports events, Sports Leaders are trained in public speaking and communication, ensuring they can confidently address and motivate large groups.

Sports Leaders are involved in organising the sports events like JVS Olympics, Annual Run and are essential leaders during the Sec One Orientation and Teachers’ Day celebration.
