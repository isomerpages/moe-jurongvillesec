## Student Council

Our Student Councillors go through a customised leadership training programme based on the Leadership Challenge by James Kouzes and Barry Posner.

For instance, the Secondary One Orientation Programme gives our Student Councillors the opportunity to **Model the Way and Encourage the Heart** when they rally their juniors to participate in the activities and showing them the values of teamwork and support.

Each year, our Student Councillors are also tasked to **Challenge the Process** and come up with innovative and creative ways to make the school experience for their peers more meaningful and memorable. In doing so, they also **Inspired a Shared Vision** by engaging fellow students in programmes that foster school pride and personal growth. One of our notable programmes was ‘Talk the Walk’ Series, where our Student Councillors facilitated the learning of our school’s PRIDE values through assembly talks and classroom discussions.

Student Councillors together with Peer Support Leaders, also organised the Student Leaders’ Investiture and the yearly Teachers’ Day celebration, where our teachers and students bonded through games and interactive activities, fostering a sense of community.

The Student Council in JVS offers students an opportunity to lead and serve the school. They are empowered to plan and organize student-led and student-initiated events for the student body. As they take on these responsibilities, they are encouraged to **Enable Others to Act**, raising collaboration and building trust within the student community.
