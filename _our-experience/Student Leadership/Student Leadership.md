## Student Leadership

#### Vision
*“Empowering every student leader to be a responsible, empathetic and innovative individual who inspires positive change within the school, community and goes Beyond Self.”*

In Jurongville Secondary School, we believe that every student has the potential to be a leader. Our Student Leadership programme is designed to nurture the qualities of responsibility, empathy and innovation, and developing students into future-ready leaders.

#### Core Values
Our Core Values are based on R.I.C.E, taking reference from The Leadership Challenge Model framework developed by James Kouzes and Barry Posner. Rice is significant in many of our local cultures; it represents life, sustenance and community. Sharing rice also symbolises generosity, kindness, and unity. In Jurongville, we aspire to develop a group of Student Leaders who demonstrate:
* **Responsibility**: We take ownership of our actions and decisions.
* **Integrity**: We lead with honesty and strong moral principles.
* **Collaboration**: We work together in service of others such as the school and community. 
* **Empathy**: We listen and understand the needs of others.

#### Objectives of JVS Student Leadership Programme
* **Develop leadership skills for personal growth**: Through workshops, mentorship and on-the-job learning, our leaders learn to build their confidence and develop their self-awareness, while learning critical skills such as communication, conflict resolution and decision-making.
* **Promote student voice**: As role models, we believe that our leaders should have an active role in shaping the school environment. Our leaders act as advocates for their peers and foster a positive school culture. 
* **Drive Innovation and Problem-Solving**: Our leaders are trained to address challenges with creative solutions, improving the school and the community.
