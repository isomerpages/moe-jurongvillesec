## Student Leadership

<img src="/images/student leadership committee teachers 2.jpg" style="width:85%">

### Overview

In line with the school’s philosophy of “everyone can learn, everyone can achieve, everyone can contribute”, It is our belief that every student can be a leader at some point in life, be it in the family, in school, in one’s social circles, and one day, in the workplace. These may be formal positions with authority or informal roles. We believe that leadership begins with self and goes beyond self. Leadership in JVS is less about position but more on a mindset demonstrated through role modeling the school values.

#### Student Leadership Framework

The focus for leadership development is to cultivate, in our students, the ability to lead and inspire self and others. The JVS student leadership framework focuses on imbuing our students with the requisite skills for leadership development as they grow into caring leaders who are empowered and enlightened to lead and serve. Using the LEARN-ACHIEVE-CONTRIBUTE school-wide approach, JVS develops its students through a systematic way by using the 3 levels of leadership from Personal leadership, Team leadership to Organizational leadership through the three domains of Leadership Programme, CCA Programme and Beyond-Self Empowerment Programme. We aim to first develop the student from within and then reaching out to the people around and eventually rising up to the occasion and/or position where the student is able to impact the community and beyond.

JVS is committed to developing our students to be role models who lead and serve. This is achieved through a structured approach, which is grounded on character development and based on Kouzes and Posner's Leadership Challenge Model. The model identifies five key leadership practices as follows:

| Leadership Practices | Brief Description | Training Focus for the level |
|:---:|---|---|
| **1 \. Modelling the Way** <img src="/images/Model.png" style="width:49%" align=right> | Leaders must start first, creating standards of excellence and setting an example for others to follow. | Sec. 1 |
| **2 \. Inspiring a Shared Vision** <img src="/images/Inspire.png" style="width:49%" align=right> | Leaders passionately believe that they can make a difference and need to communicate it effectively so others take it as their own. | Sec. 2 |
| **3 \. Challenging the Process** <img src="/images/Challenge.png" style="width:49%" align=right> | Leaders are innovators. They are willing to challenge the norm and say ‘Why NOT?’ instead of ‘Why?’ | Sec. 3 |
| **4 \. Enabling Others to Act** <img src="/images/Enable.png" style="width:49%" align=right> | Leaders actively involve others and strive to create an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect. |  |
| **5 \. Encouraging the Heart** <img src="/images/Encourage.png" style="width:49%" align=right> | Leaders must recognise contributionsthat others make. Always make others feel like heroes. | Sec. 4/5 |
