The DSA-Sec and S1 Posting are the two modes of admission to Secondary Schools. Primary 6 (P6) students who wish to seek admission to a secondary school based on their achievements and talents beyond PSLE can consider applying through the DSA-Sec. Otherwise, students will take part in the S1 Posting, whereby admission is based on merit according to their PSLE results.
