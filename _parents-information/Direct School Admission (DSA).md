Otherwise, students will take part in the S1 Posting, whereby admission is based on merit according to their PSLE results.  

The following are the various specific talent areas offered by Jurongville Secondary School for the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise.

The following is the write up for the various specific talent areas offered by Jurongville Secondary School for the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise.

#### Applied Learning Programme (ALP)

Jurongville Secondary School’s distinctive ALP, “Real-World Learning Through Electronics”, enables students to appreciate the applications and importance of electronics in everyday life, potentially grooming them into **community-spirited engineers**. Our exciting **ALP project work** curriculum allows students to learn about electronics, coding, robotics, computational thinking and AI (artificial intelligence). Through our talent development programme, Electronic Ambassadors are given opportunities to be stretched and developed in their interests through participation in competitions, learning journeys and work attachments beyond the school. Jurongville Secondary School also offers specialized applied subjects: Electronics offered at O-level and Smart Electrical Technology (SET) at the NT-level for students who are interested in deepening their learning and understanding in these areas.

#### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

Jurongville’s **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)** involves a whole school approach to **Character Building through Sports**. <br>
The overall curriculum consists of three main tiers, namely, **Sports Exposure, Sports Empowerment and Sports Excellence**. Values such as perseverance, respect, integrity, discipline & empathy are reinforced through the learning experiences in each tier.  <br>
