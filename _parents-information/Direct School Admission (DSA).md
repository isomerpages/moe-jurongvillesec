Through our talent development programme, Electronic Ambassadors are given opportunities to be stretched and developed in their interests through participation in competitions, learning journeys and work attachments beyond the school. Jurongville Secondary School also offers specialized applied subjects: Electronics offered at O-level and Smart Electrical Technology (SET) at the NT-level for students who are interested in deepening their learning and understanding in these areas.
