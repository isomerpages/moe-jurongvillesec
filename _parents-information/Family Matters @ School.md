#### JVS FamilyMatters@School programmes

Lakeside Family Services has been appointed by MSF in 2020 to deliver parenting support services to Jurongville Secondary School. Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) is an evidence-based programme that equips parents with techniques to promote your childrenâ€™s (aged up to 16 years) psychological, social and emotional competencies. Triple P is built on a tiered system that provides different degrees of parental support.

The Triple P Seminars will be held on Zoom. The Programme is a strategy designed to better support and empower parents with the skills in maintaining positive parent-child relationship. More details of the seminars will be provided soon.
