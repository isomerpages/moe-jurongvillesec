## Financial Assistance Scheme

The following financial assistance schemes are available to needy Singaporean students.
Financial Assistance by Ministry of Education (MOE FAS)

Applicants whose family income is not within the MOE FASâ€™s income criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis for School-based FAS. Benefits received by eligible students may include one or more of the following:
Subsidies for school meals for every school day
Complimentary textbooks
Complimentary school uniform

#### How to Apply
Application for new MOE FAS is open throughout the year. Information on the MOE FAS can be found here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance](https://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/financial-assistance). The application form can be downloaded from the school website: [financial-assistance-scheme](/files/2023%20MOE%20FAS%20Application%20Form.pdf) Alternatively, the form may be obtained from the General Office. To renew the financial assistance for the next calendar year, students will have to submit new application form and supporting documents to the General Office. The school will not reimburse the parents or the successful applicants if they had first paid for the school attire or textbooks.
