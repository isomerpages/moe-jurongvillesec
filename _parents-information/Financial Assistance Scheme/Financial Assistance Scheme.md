## Financial Assistance Scheme

The following financial assistance schemes are available to needy Singaporean students.<br>
1 \.  Financial Assistance by Ministry of Education (MOE FAS)<br>
2 \.  Financial Assistance by the School Advisory Committee (School-based FAS)

Applicants whose family income is not within the MOE FAS’s income criteria will be considered on a case-by-case basis for School-based FAS. Benefits received by eligible students may include one or more of the following:  
*   Subsidies for school meals for every school day
*   Complimentary textbooks
*   Complimentary school uniform

**How to Apply** <br>
Application for new MOE FAS is open throughout the year. Students may download the financial assistance application form from [http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/financial-assistance](http://www.moe.gov.sg/initiatives/financial-assistance) **PAGE NOT FOUND**. Alternatively, the form may be obtained from the General. To renew the financial assistance for the next calendar year, students will have to submit new application form and supporting documents to the General Office. The school will not reimburse the parents or the successful applicants if they had first paid for the school attire or textbooks.
