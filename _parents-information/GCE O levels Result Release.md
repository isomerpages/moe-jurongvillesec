<h2>GCE O-Level Results</h2>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 2024 O-Level results will be released on <strong>Friday, 10 January 2025, at 2:30 pm.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As your child reaches this significant milestone, it is important to remind
them that their worth is not defined by their grades but by the character
and resilience they have developed throughout their journey. Your support
will be invaluable in helping them manage their emotions and stay positive
as they consider their next steps.</p>
<h4>Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG) Parent Engagement</h4>
<p>We warmly invite you and your child to attend the ECG Parent Engagement
Session before the release of the results. This session will provide valuable
guidance on the various education and career pathways available, enabling
you to make well-informed decisions together.</p>

and grooming standards must be adhered to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

top and a school skirt or long pants, paired with proper school shoes.</p>
