## GCE O levels Result Release

Dear parents, <br>
The O-Level results will be released on 11 Jan 2021. It is a major milestone for our teens. Regardless of the outcome, it is important for your child to know that they are loved for who they are, and that the exam grades do not define their future. The social & emotional support you provide will be especially valuable & crucial in helping them to manage their emotions & be positive when deciding on their next steps.<br>
We encourage our students to return to school to collect their results. However, students who are unable to return to school may view their results online. Students who are eligible for SingPass can use their SingPass account to access SEAB’s online results release system. Please refer to the link below. Students who feel unwell should not come to school on 11 Jan. They can return to school to collect the relevant documents when they have recovered.

Your child was informed earlier of the following:<br>
(1) Report to school & be seated in the classroom by 1.45 pm.<br>
(2) Be properly attired in school uniform (black top, green pants/skirt, school shoes); with normal hair colour.<br>
(3) Only students collecting their results will be allowed entry into school.<br>
(4) Students who are unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, should not return to school to collect their results.<br>
For more resources on providing social and emotional support, affirming your teen, & supporting your teen’s transition through post-secondary education, please refer to the web link below. 

For ECG counselling services, students may contact the ECG Counsellor in their schools. Students may also contact the ECG Centre @ MOE (Grange Road) for online or phone counselling appointments between 6 to 20 January 2021 via email: [moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg](mailto:moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg), the appointment booking form: [https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre](https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre) or phone: 68311420 (operating hours are 9.00 am to 5.00 pm on weekdays and 9.00 am to 12.30 pm on Saturdays). 

Thank you. JVS PG Team
