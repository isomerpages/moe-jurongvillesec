<p>As MOE student, your child is covered under the Group Personal Accident
Insurance for Students.</p>
<p>This is a Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance which covers death,
permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses due to an accident
that arises from school activities. The proximate or triggering causes
of injuries must be reasonably attributed to an accident.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before
submitting claims to Income Insurance Limited (Income Insurance) for reimbursement.
Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible
expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardians.
Parents/guardians should also take note that medical treatments at private
hospitals will typically cost higher, and parents/guardians may need to
pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policyâ€™s
coverage limits.</p>
