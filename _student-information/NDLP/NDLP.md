## NDLP

#### National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)in Jurongville

#### Our Vision for Learning

Jurongville aims to be a vibrant and nurturing community of passionate and resilient learners. Through NDLP, we will leverage technology to help us get there.

When our teachers skilfully design lessons that integrate technology meaningfully, we believe that our students will&nbsp;  

*   Learn more actively
*   Think more Critically and Creatively
*   Experience more joy and success at learning.&nbsp;

At the broader level, the wider and deeper use of technology in learning will better prepare our students for the post-COVID world. Our students will be expected to have good digital skills, and to use those skills confidently and competently at work and in life.  

At the same time, we would also need to equip our students with the ability to manage their usage of devices, so that they remain in control of the ‘machines’, rather than the other way round. Their personal well-being will be enhanced through greater emphasis on Cyberwellness next year.

#### Parent Engagement

We aim to explain more about our school’s plans for NDLP in January 2021. If the COVID-19 situation allows, we hope to invite parents to school for a conversation on this important change in the way students learn in school.  

In the meantime, if there are any further updates, we will alert parents through Parents’ Gateway and publish them on the school’s website.
