## Welcoming our New Sec JV-nites

Our student councilors led the new Sec 1 JV-nites through a week of activity-filled Orientation at the start of Term 1 with the campfire celebration as our finale to a week-long programme.

With this, the Sec 1 students found new friends, are familiar with the school environment and are ready to journey their secondary school experiences with us.

Below are some of the information that may be useful for the parents of our Sec 1 students.

For further clarifications, you can connect with us either via our school email address: [jurongville@moe.edu.sg](mailto:jurongville@moe.edu.sg) or via our General Office number 65638704.
